      "319 |||| [56] - Just sit somewhere else.\n",
      "320 |||| [59] Sheldon, sit.\n",
      "321 Well, this is nice.\n",
      "322 We don't have a lot of company over.\n",
      "323 That's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.\n",
      "324 Yes, I know.\n",
      "325 Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle until 1 in the morning.\n",
      "326 - Yeah, I remember.\n",
      "327 |||| [63] - I resent you saying we don't have company.\n",
      "328 - That has a negative social implication.\n",
      "329 |||| [66] - I said I'm sorry.\n",
      "330 |||| [67] So Klingon Boggle?\n",
      "331 Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but in Klingon.\n",
      "332 That's probably enough about us. So tell us about you.\n",
      "333 I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\n",
      "334 |||| [68] Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun's position relative to arbitrary constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality.\n",
      "335 |||| [69] Participate in the what?\n",
      "336 |||| [70] I think what Sheldon's trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.\n",
      "337 |||| [71] Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign.\n",
      "338 |||| [71] Okay, let's see, what else?\n",
      "339 |||| [71] Oh, I'm a vegetarian.\n",
      "340 |||| [71] No, except for fish, and the occasional steak.\n",
      "341 Well, that's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.\n",
      "342 |||| [74] So do you have some sort of a job? PENNY:\n",
      "343 |||| [75] Oh, yeah. I'm a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "344 |||| [75] I love cheesecake.\n",
      "345 |||| [75] - You're lactose intolerant.\n",
      "346 |||| [75] - I don't eat it, I think it's a good idea.\n",
      "347 |||| [75] Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.\n",
      "348 |||| [75] It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska to be an actress and winds up a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "349 So it's based on your life.\n",
      "350 No, I'm from Omaha.\n",
      "351 |||| [76] If that was a movie, I would go see it.\n",
      "352 I know, right?\n",
      "353 Okay, let's see, what else?\n",
      "354 I guess that's about it.\n",
      "355 |||| [77] That's the story of Penny.\n",
      "356 |||| [78] Well, it sounds wonderful.\n",
      "357 |||| [79] It was.\n",
      "358 |||| [79] Until I fell in love with a jerk.\n",
      "359 [MOUTHS] I don't know.\n",
      "360 |||| [82] Oh, God, you know, four years I lived with him.\n",
      "361 |||| [82] Four years. That's like as long as high school.\n",
      "362 |||| [83] It took you four years to get through high school?\n",
      "363 |||| [85] I just... I can't believe I trusted him.\n",
      "364 Should I say something?\n",
      "365 I feel I should say something. You?\n",
      "366 |||| [87] No, you'll only make it worse.\n",
      "367 You wanna know the most pathetic part?\n",
      "368 |||| [88] Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts I still love him.\n",
      "369 |||| [88] Is that crazy?\n",
      "370 No, it's not crazy.\n",
      "371 It's a...\n",
      "372 It's a paradox.\n",
      "373 Paradoxes are part of nature.\n",
      "374 I mean, think about light. If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments.\n",
      "375 But then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too.\n",
      "376 Well, I didn't make it worse.\n",
      "377 Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.\n",
      "378 And on top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't work.\n",
      "379 Our shower works.\n",
      "380 Would it be totally weird if I used it?\n",
      "381 - No?\n",
      "382 |||| [89] It's right down the hall.\n",
      "383 |||| [90] Okay, thanks. You guys are really sweet.\n",
      "384 Well, this is an interesting development.\n",
      "385 LEONARD: How so?\n",
      "386 SHELDON: It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\n",
      "387 That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?\n",
      "388 It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.\n",
      "389 The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\n",
      "390 So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\n",
      "391 That woman in there is not going to have sex with you.\n",
      "392 Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.\n",
      "393 |||| [91] Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "394 |||| [92] What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?\n",
      "395 |||| [92] I'm a male and she's a female.\n",
      "396 |||| [93] Yes, but not of the same species.\n",
      "397 I'm not gonna engage in hypotheticals here.\n",
      "398 |||| [94] - I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.\n",
      "399 - Oh, of course.\n",
      "400 That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate.\n",
      "401 However briefly.\n",
      "402 Do you think this possibility will be hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker \"no more tears\" shampoo?\n",
      "403 It's Darth Vader shampoo.\n",
      "404 Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.\n",
      "405 - Wait till you see this.\n",
      "406 - It's fantastic. Unbelievable.\n",
      "407 See what?\n",
      "408 It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\n",
      "409 This isn't a good time.\n",
      "410 [IMITATING COMPUTERIZED VOICE] It's before he became a creepy computer voice.\n",
      "411 - That's great, you guys have to go.\n",
      "412 - It's just not a good time.\n",
      "413 - Leonard has a lady over.\n",
      "414 [IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah, right. Your grandmother back in town?\n",
      "415 |||| [95] No.\n",
      "416 |||| [95] And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.\n",
      "417 |||| [96] Hang on, there really is a lady here?\n",
      "418 |||| [97] - Uh-huh.\n",
      "419 |||| [98] - And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?\n",
      "420 - I'm not anticipating coitus.\n",
      "421 - So she's available for coitus?\n",
      "422 Can we please just stop saying \"coitus\"?\n",
      "423 Technically, that would be coitus interruptus.\n",
      "424 |||| [99] Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower?\n",
      "425 |||| [99] Oh, hi, sorry. Hello.\n",
      "426 Enchanté, mademoiselle.\n",
      "427 Howard Wolowitz, CalTech Department of Applied Physics.\n",
      "428 You may be familiar with some of my work.\n",
      "429 It's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\n",
      "430 |||| [102] Penny. I work at The Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "431 |||| [103] - I'll show you the trick with the shower. - Okay.\n",
      "432 [SPEAKS IN FRENCH]\n",
      "433 |||| [105] It's French for \"good shower.\"\n",
      "434 |||| [105] It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.\n",
      "435 |||| [106] Save it for your blog, Howard.\n",
      "436 [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]\n",
      "437 LEONARD: All right, there it goes. It sticks, I'm sorry.\n",
      "438 - Okay, thanks.\n",
      "439 |||| [107] - You're welcome. Oh, you're just gonna step right...?\n",
      "440 |||| [107] Okay.\n",
      "441 PENNY: Hey, Leonard?\n",
      "442 |||| [109] - The hair products are Sheldon's.\n",
      "443 PENNY: Okay.\n",
      "444 |||| [110] - Um, can I ask you a favor?\n",
      "445 - A favor?\n",
      "446 Sure, you could ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.\n",
      "447 - It's okay if you say no.\n",
      "448 - Oh, I'll probably say yes.\n",
      "449 It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.\n",
      "450 I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.\n",
      "451 - Must we?\n",
      "452 |||| [113] - Event A:\n",
      "453 |||| [113] A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower.\n",
      "454 |||| [113] Event B:\n",
      "455 |||| [113] We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend.\n",
      "456 |||| [113] On what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?\n",
      "457 |||| [114] She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.\n",
      "458 Well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it exists in contradistinction to the higher-level distal cause.\n",
      "459 - Which is?\n",
      "460 - You think with your penis.\n",
      "461 |||| [115] That's a biological impossibility, and you didn't have to come.\n",
      "462 |||| [116] I could have stayed behind to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.\n",
      "463 |||| [116] And why can't she get her own TV?\n",
      "464 |||| [117] Come on, you know how it is with breakups.\n",
      "465 No, I don't, and neither do you.\n",
      "466 But I... I broke up with Joyce Kim.\n",
      "467 |||| [118] You did not break up with Joyce Kim. She defected to North Korea.\n",
      "468 |||| [119] To mend her broken heart.\n",
      "469 |||| [119] This situation is much less complicated.\n",
      "470 |||| [119] There's some dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV.\n",
      "471 |||| [119] - She just wanted to avoid a scene with him.\n",
      "472 - So we get to have a scene with him?\n",
      "473 No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene.\n",
      "474 There's two of us and one of him.\n",
      "475 Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.\n",
      "476 So you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?\n",
      "477 |||| [120] I'm sorry, do you speak English?\n",
      "478 |||| [121] Oh, he speaks English. He just can't speak to women.\n",
      "479 |||| [123] He's kind of a nerd.\n",
      "480 |||| [123] Juice box?\n",
      "481 - I'll do the talking.\n",
      "482 MAN: Yeah?\n",
      "483 - Hi. I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n",
      "484 What did I just...?\n",
      "485 - We're here to pick up Penny's TV.\n",
      "486 - Get lost.\n",
      "487 Okay, thanks for your time.\n",
      "488 - We're not gonna give up just like that.\n",
      "489 - Leonard, the TV's in the building.\n",
      "490 We've been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.\n",
      "491 If I were to give up at the first hitch, I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.\n",
      "492 My apologies. What's your plan?\n",
      "493 |||| [125] It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.\n",
      "494 Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360.\n",
      "495 We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n",
      "496 - What do you think their combined IQ is?\n",
      "497 - Just grab the door.\n",
      "498 LEONARD: This is it.\n",
      "499 I'll do the talking.\n",
      "500 Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.\n",
      "501 - I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n",
      "502 From the intercom.\n",
      "503 How the hell did you get in the building?\n",
      "504 Tell him about our IQ.\n",
      "505 - Leonard. - What?\n",
      "506 |||| [126] - My mom bought me those pants.\n",
      "507 You're gonna have to call her.\n",
      "508 Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.\n",
      "509 It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.\n",
      "510 And you were right about my motives.\n",
      "511 I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have someday led to sex.\n",
      "512 SHELDON: Well, you got me out of my pants.\n",
      "513 Anyway, I've learned my lesson.\n",
      "514 She's out of my league, I'm done with her.\n",
      "515 I've got my work. One day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.\n",
      "516 Don't think like that. You're not going to die alone.\n",
      "517 Thank you, Sheldon. You're a good friend.\n",
      "518 SHELDON: And you're certainly not gonna win a Nobel Prize.\n",
      "519 This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest.\n",
      "520 They have a great house ale.\n",
      "521 PENNY: Wow, cool tiger.\n",
      "522 |||| [129] Yeah, I've had him since Level 10.\n",
      "523 |||| [129] His name is Buttons.\n",
      "524 |||| [129] Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.\n",
      "525 - That sounds interesting.\n",
      "526 - So you'll think about it?\n",
      "527 Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.\n",
      "528 |||| [136] Smooth.\n",
      "529 |||| [137] - We're home.\n",
      "530 |||| [138] - Oh, my God. What happened?\n",
      "531 |||| [139] Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.\n",
      "532 |||| [140] I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.\n",
      "533 |||| [141] No, it was a valid hypothesis.\n",
      "534 That was a valid hypo...?\n",
      "535 What is happening to you?\n",
      "536 |||| [142] Really, thank you so much for going and trying.\n",
      "537 |||| [142] You just... You're so terrific.\n",
      "538 |||| [142] Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?\n",
      "539 |||| [143] - Really? Great.\n",
      "540 |||| [144] - Thank you.\n",
      "541 |||| [144] You're not done with her, are you?\n",
      "542 Our babies will be smart and beautiful.\n",
      "543 Not to mention imaginary.\n",
      "544 - Is Thai food okay with you, Penny? - Sure.\n",
      "545 We can't have Thai, we had Indian for lunch.\n",
      "546 - They're both curry-based cuisines.\n",
      "547 - It would be gastronomically redundant.\n",
      "548 I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.\n",
      "549 Any ideas, Raj?\n",
      "550 Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado.\n",
      "551 I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.\n",
      "552 Oh, that sounds like fun.\n",
      "553 [SINGING] Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me\n",
      "554 Oh, baby, baby Don't get hooked on me\n",
      "555 I don't know your odds in the world as a whole but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mac daddy.\n",
      "556 Baby, don't get hooked on me\n",
      "557 Yo, we should just play this straight up.\n",
      "558 Those cats will fold under pressure.\n",
      "559 We can take these fools with our eyes closed. Come on.\n",
      "560 No doubt, but I don't wanna diss them in front of their home crowd.\n",
      "561 D, I got you.\n",
      "562 I got y'all.\n",
      "563 -All right, man. -Come on, let's do it.\n",
      "564 All right, all right, y'all, that was hot!\n",
      "565 And the winner is... .\n",

      "572 You haven't seen him pop. Come on, come on.\n",
      "573 -Hey, I got that. -Get out of here!\n",
      "574 -Get back. -Break it up.\n",
      "575 -Get back. Get back. -We good.\n",
      "576 All right, all right, let's hear it for the Thug Unit.\n",
      "577 Give it up for the Goon Squad !\n",
      "578 What's up? I think the Goon Squad got it, y'all.\n",

      "588 -The more paper we take home.\n",
      "589 -Did you see that cat?\n",
      "590 If he thinks he's being hustled, that's paper we won't spend.\n",

      "601 You know, it's gonna get nasty up in here!\n",
      "602 -Don't wanna let stuff get out of hand--\n",
      "603 -Don't sweat it.\n",
      "604 We came too far to turn back now, baby boy. I want this.\n",
      "605 You want this?\n",
      "606 I knew you'd say something like you want this.\n",
      "607 That's all this is about. Typical DJ.\n",
      "608 It's not just about you, it's about all of us. We're a team.\n",

      "621 -Man, I don't know.\n",
      "622 -l got a little something for y'all. -All right. All right.\n",
