It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. \n",

      " That is an antisocial implication.\n",
      " I said I’m sorry.\n",
      " So, Klingon boggle?\n",
      " Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.\n",
      " Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\n",
      " Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.\n",
      " Participate in the what?\n",
      " I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.\n",
      " Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. \n",
      " That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.\n",
      " Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?\n",
      " Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      " Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.\n",
      " You’re lactose intolerant. \n",
      " I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea.\n",
      " Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      " So it’s based on your life?\n",
      " No, I’m from Omaha. \n",
      " Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.\n",
      " I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.\n",
      " Well it sounds wonderful.\n",
      " It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. \n",
      " What’s happening.\n",
      " I don’t know.\n",
      " Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. \n",
      " It took you four years to get through High School?\n",
      " Don’t.\n",
      " I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.\n",
      " Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.\n",
      " You? No, you’ll only make it worse.\n",
      " You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?\n",
      " No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.\n",
      " Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.\n",
      " Our shower works.\n",
      " Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?\n",
      " Yes. \n",
      " No?\n",
      " No.\n",
      " No.\n",

      " Well this is an interesting development. \n",
      " How so?\n",
      " It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\n",
      " That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.\n",
      " Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. \n",
      " The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\n",
      " So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\n",
      " Excuse me?\n",
      " That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.\n",
      " Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.\n",
      " Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.\n",
      " What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?\n",
      " Yes, but not of the same species.\n",
      " I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.\n",
      " Oh, of course.\n",
      " That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.\n",
      " Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?\n",
      " It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.\n",
      " Wait till you see this.\n",
      " It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.\n",
      " See what?\n",
      " It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\n",
      " This is not a good time.\n",
      " It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.\n",
      " That’s great, you guys have to go.\n",
      " Why?\n",
      " It’s just not a good time.\n",
      " Leonard has a lady over.\n",
      " Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?\n",
      " No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.\n",
      " Hang on, there really is a lady here?\n",
      " Uh-huh.\n",
      " And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?\n",
      " I’m not anticipating coitus.\n",
      " So she’s available for coitus?\n",
      " Can we please stop saying coitus?\n",
      " Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\n",
      " Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!\n",
      " Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\n",

      " Bon douche.\n",

      " It’s okay if you say no.\n",
      " Oh, I’ll probably say yes.\n",

      " She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.\n",
      " Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.\n",
      " Which is?\n",
      " You think with your penis.\n",
      " That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.\n",
      " Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.\n",
      " Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.\n",
      " No I don’t. And neither do you.\n",
      " Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.\n",
      " You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.\n",
      " To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.\n",
      " So we get to have a scene with him?\n",
      " No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.\n",
      " Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV. \n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",

      " Well you got me out of my pants.\n",
      " Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.\n",
