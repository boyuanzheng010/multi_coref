I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect.

      "95 Leonard  You’re very welcome.\n",
      "96 |||| [293] Penny  This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?\n",
      "97 Sheldon  Actually that’s my work.\n",
      "98 Penny  Wow.\n",
      "99 |||| [295, 296] Sheldon  Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.\n",
      "100 |||| [297] Penny  So you’re like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.\n",
      "101 Sheldon  Yeah. \n",
      "102 |||| [299] Penny  This is really impressive.\n",
      "103 |||| [300] Leonard  I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.\n",
      "104 |||| [301] Penny  Holy smokes.\n",
      "105 |||| [302] Sheldon  If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure.\n",
      "106 Leonard  What?\n",
      "107 |||| [303] Sheldon  Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”\n",
      "108 |||| [304] Leonard  At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.\n",
      "109 Sheldon  I didn’t invent them, they’re there.\n",
      "110 |||| [306] Leonard  In what universe?\n",
      "111 |||| [307] Sheldon  In all of them, that is the point.\n",
      "112 |||| [308] Penny  Uh, do you guys mind if I start?\n",
      "113 Sheldon  Um, Penny, that’s where I sit.\n",
      "114 |||| [311] Penny  So, sit next to me. \n",
      "115 |||| [312] Sheldon  No, I sit there.\n",
      "116 Penny  What’s the difference?\n",
      "117 Sheldon  What’s the difference?\n",
      "118 |||| [313] Leonard  Here we go.\n",
      "119 |||| [314, 315, 316, 317] Sheldon  In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. \n",
      "120 |||| [318] Penny  Do you want me to move?\n",
      "121 Sheldon  Well.\n",
      "122 |||| [319] Leonard  Just sit somewhere else.\n",
      "123 Sheldon  Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)\n",
      "124 |||| [320] Leonard  Sheldon, sit!\n",
      "125 Sheldon  Aaah!\n",
      "126 |||| [321, 322] Leonard  Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of company over.\n",
      "127 Sheldon  That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. \n",
      "128 Leonard  Yes I now, but…\n",
      "129 |||| [325] Sheldon  Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.\n",
      "130 Leonard  Yes, I remember.\n",
      "131 |||| [327] Sheldon  I resent you saying we don’t have company.\n",
      "132 Leonard  I’m sorry.\n",
      "133 Sheldon  That is an antisocial implication.\n",
      "134 Leonard  I said I’m sorry.\n",
      "135 |||| [330] Penny  So, Klingon boggle?\n",
      "136 |||| [331, 332] Leonard  Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably enough about us, tell us about you.\n",
      "137 |||| [333] Penny  Um, me, okay, I’m Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.\n",
      "138 |||| [334] Sheldon  Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.\n",
      "139 |||| [335] Penny  Participate in the what?\n",
      "140 |||| [336] Leonard  I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess.\n",
      "141 |||| [337, 340] Penny  Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I’m a water sign. Okay, let’s see, what else, oh, I’m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. \n",
      "142 Sheldon  That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn.\n",
      "143 |||| [342] Leonard  Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?\n",
      "144 Penny  Oh, yeah, I’m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "145 Leonard  Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.\n",
      "146 Sheldon  You’re lactose intolerant. \n",
      "147 Leonard  I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good idea.\n",
      "148 Penny  Oh, anyways, I’m also writing a screenplay. It’s about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "149 Leonard  So it’s based on your life?\n",
      "150 Penny  No, I’m from Omaha. \n",
      "151 |||| [351] Leonard  Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.\n",
      "152 Penny  I know, right? Okay, let’s see, what else? Um, that’s about it. That’s the story of Penny.\n",
      "153 |||| [356] Leonard  Well it sounds wonderful.\n",
      "154 |||| [357, 358] Penny  It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. \n",
      "155 (mouths)  What’s happening.\n",
      "156 back)  I don’t know.\n",
      "157 |||| [360, 361] Penny  Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that’s like as long as High School. \n",
      "158 |||| [362] Sheldon  It took you four years to get through High School?\n",
      "159 Leonard  Don’t.\n",
      "160 |||| [363] Penny  I just, I can’t believe I trusted him.\n",
      "161 |||| [364, 365] Leonard  Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.\n",
      "162 Sheldon  You? No, you’ll only make it worse.\n",
      "163 |||| [367, 368, 369] Penny  You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?\n",
      "164 Sheldon  Yes. \n",
      "165 |||| [373, 374, 375] Leonard  No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn’t make it worse.\n",
      "166 |||| [378] Penny  Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m such a mess, and on top of everything else I’m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn’t even work.\n",
      "167 |||| [379] Leonard  Our shower works.\n",
      "168 |||| [380] Penny  Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?\n",
      "169 Sheldon  Yes. \n",
      "170 Leonard  No.\n",
      "171 Sheldon  No?\n",
      "172 Leonard  No.\n",
      "173 Sheldon  No.\n",
      "174 Leonard  It’s right down the hall.\n",
      "175 |||| [383] Penny  Thanks. You guys are really sweet.\n",
      "176 |||| [384] Sheldon  Well this is an interesting development. \n",
      "177 Leonard  How so?\n",
      "178 Sheldon  It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\n",
      "179 |||| [387] Leonard  That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s had that episode.\n",
      "180 Sheldon  Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. \n",
      "181 |||| [389] Leonard  The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\n",
      "182 |||| [390] Sheldon  So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\n",
      "183 Leonard  Excuse me?\n",
      "184 Sheldon  That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.\n",
      "185 Leonard  Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.\n",
      "186 |||| [393] Sheldon  Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.\n",
      "187 |||| [394, 395] Leonard  What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me, I’m a male and she’s a female?\n",
      "188 |||| [396] Sheldon  Yes, but not of the same species.\n",
      "189 |||| [398] Leonard  I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just trying to be a good neighbour.\n",
      "190 |||| [399] Sheldon  Oh, of course.\n",
      "191 |||| [400, 401] Leonard  That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.\n",
      "192 |||| [402] Sheldon  Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?\n",
      "193 Leonard  It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.\n",
      "194 |||| [405] Howard  Wait till you see this.\n",
      "195 Raj  It’s fantastic. Unbelievable.\n",
      "196 |||| [407] Leonard  See what?\n",
      "197 |||| [408] Howard  It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.\n",
      "198 |||| [409] Leonard  This is not a good time.\n",
      "199 |||| [410] Howard  It’s before he became a creepy computer voice:.\n",
      "200 |||| [411] Leonard  That’s great, you guys have to go.\n",
      "201 Raj  Why?\n",
      "202 |||| [412] Leonard  It’s just not a good time.\n",
      "203 |||| [413] Sheldon  Leonard has a lady over.\n",
      "204 |||| [414] Howard  Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?\n",
      "205 |||| [415, 416] Leonard  No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new neighbour.\n",
      "206 |||| [417] Howard  Hang on, there really is a lady here?\n",
      "207 |||| [418] Leonard  Uh-huh.\n",
      "208 |||| [419] Howard  And you want us out because you’re anticipating coitus?\n",
      "209 Leonard  I’m not anticipating coitus.\n",
      "210 Howard  So she’s available for coitus?\n",
      "211 Leonard  Can we please stop saying coitus?\n",
      "212 |||| [423] Sheldon  Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\n",
      "213 |||| [424, 425] Penny  Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!\n",
      "214 |||| [427, 428, 429] Howard  Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it’s currently orbiting Jupiter’s largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.\n",
      "215 |||| [430] Penny  Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.\n",
      "216 |||| [431] Leonard  Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower.\n",
      "217 Howard  Bon douche.\n",
      "218 Penny  I’m sorry?\n",
      "219 |||| [434] Howard  It’s French for good shower. It’s a sentiment I can express in six languages.\n",
      "220 |||| [435] Leonard  Save it for your blog, Howard.\n",
      "221 Howard  See-ka-tong-guay-jow.\n",
      "222 |||| [437] Leonard  Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry.\n",
      "223 |||| [438] Penny  Okay. Thanks. \n",
      "224 Leonard  You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll….\n",
      "225 Penny  Hey, Leonard?\n",
      "226 |||| [442] Leonard  The hair products are Sheldon’s.\n",
      "227 |||| [444] Penny  Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.\n",
      "228 |||| [446] Leonard  A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.\n",
      "229 |||| [447] Penny  It’s okay if you say no.\n",
      "230 Leonard  Oh, I’ll probably say yes.\n",
      "231 |||| [449] Penny  It’s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you’ve just met.\n",
      "232 Leonard  Wow.\n",
      "233 |||| [450] Sheldon  I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.\n",
      "234 |||| [451] Leonard  Must we?\n",
      "235 |||| [452, 453, 455, 456] Sheldon  Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?\n",
      "236 |||| [457] Leonard  She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.\n",
      "237 |||| [458] Sheldon  Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.\n",
      "238 |||| [459] Leonard  Which is?\n",
      "239 |||| [460] Sheldon  You think with your penis.\n",
      "240 |||| [461] Leonard  That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.\n",
      "241 |||| [462, 463] Sheldon  Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can’t she get her own TV.\n",
      "242 |||| [464] Leonard  Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.\n",
      "243 Sheldon  No I don’t. And neither do you.\n",
      "244 |||| [466] Leonard  Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.\n",
      "245 |||| [467] Sheldon  You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.\n",
      "246 |||| [468, 469, 470, 471] Leonard  To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.\n",
      "247 |||| [472] Sheldon  So we get to have a scene with him?\n",
      "248 |||| [473, 474] Leonard  No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s two of us and one of him.\n",
      "249 |||| [475] Sheldon  Leonard, the two of us can’t even carry a TV. \n",
      "250 |||| [476] Raj)  So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?\n",
      "251 |||| [477] Penny  Uh, I’m sorry, do you speak English?\n",
      "252 |||| [478] Howard  Oh, he speaks English, he just can’t speak to women.\n",
      "253 Penny  Really, why?\n",
      "254 Howard  He’s kind of a nerd. Juice box?\n",
      "255 buzzer)  I’ll do the talking.\n",
      "256 buzzer  Yeah.\n",
      "257 Leonard  Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n",
      "258 Sheldon  Hello.\n",
      "259 |||| [484, 485] Leonard  What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny’s TV.\n",
      "260 |||| [486] Voice  Get lost.\n",
      "261 |||| [487] Sheldon  Okay, thanks for your time.\n",
      "262 |||| [488] Leonard  We’re not going to give up just like that.\n",
      "263 |||| [489, 490] Sheldon  Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.\n",
      "264 |||| [491] Leonard  Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.\n",
      "265 Sheldon  My apologies. What’s your plan.\n",
      "266 |||| [493] Sheldon  It’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work.\n",
      "267 |||| [494, 495] Leonard  Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.\n",
      "268 |||| [496] Sheldon  What do you think their combined IQ is?\n",
      "269 |||| [497] Leonard  Just grab the door.\n",
      "270 Leonard  This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking.\n",
      "271 Sheldon  Good thinking, I’ll just be the muscle.\n",
      "272 man  Yeah?\n",
      "273 Leonard  I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.\n",
      "274 |||| [502] Sheldon  From the intercom.\n",
      "275 |||| [503] Man  How the hell did you get in the building?\n",
      "276 Leonard  Oh. We’re scientists.\n",
      "277 |||| [504] Sheldon  Tell him about our IQ.\n",
      "278 Sheldon  Leonard.\n",
      "279 Leonard  What?\n",
      "280 |||| [506] Sheldon  My mom bought me those pants.\n",
      "281 Leonard  I’m sorry.\n",
      "282 Sheldon  You’re going to have to call her.\n",
      "283 |||| [508] Leonard  Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.\n",
      "284 |||| [509] Sheldon  It’s okay. It wasn’t my first pantsing, and it won’t be my last.\n",
      "285 |||| [510, 511] Leonard  And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.\n",
      "286 |||| [512] Sheldon  Well you got me out of my pants.\n",
      "287 |||| [514, 515] Leonard  Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league, I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.\n",
      "288 |||| [516] Sheldon  Don’t think like that, you’re not going to die alone.\n",
      "289 |||| [517] Leonard  Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend.\n",
      "290 Sheldon  And you’re certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.\n",
      "291 |||| [519, 520] Howard  This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.\n",
      "292 Penny  Wow, cool tiger.\n",
      "293 |||| [522, 524] Howard  Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.\n",
      "294 Penny  Uh, sounds interesting.\n",
      "295 Howard  So you’ll think about it?\n",
      "296 |||| [527] Penny  Oh, I don’t think I’ll be able to stop thinking about it.\n",
      "297 |||| [528] Raj  Smooth.\n",
      "298 Leonard  We’re home.\n",
      "299 |||| [530] Penny  Oh, my God, what happened?\n",
      "300 |||| [531] Leonard  Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.\n",
      "301 |||| [532] Penny  I’m so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn’t be such an ass.\n",
      "302 |||| [533] Leonard  No, it was a valid hypothesis.\n",
      "303 |||| [534, 535] Sheldon  That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?\n",
      "304 |||| [536, 538] Penny  Really, thank you so much for going and trying you’re, uh, you’re so terrific. Why don’t you put some clothes on, I’ll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?\n",
      "305 |||| [539] Leonard  Really? Great.\n",
      "306 |||| [540, 541] Sheldon  Thank you. You’re not done with her, are you?\n",
      "307 |||| [542] Leonard  Our babies will be smart and beautiful.\n",
      "308 |||| [543] Sheldon  Not to mention imaginary.\n",
      "309 |||| [544] Leonard  Is Thai food okay with you Penny?\n",
      "310 Penny  Sure.\n",
      "311 |||| [545] Sheldon  We can’t have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.\n",
      "312 Penny  So?\n",
      "313 Sheldon  They’re both curry based cuisines.\n",
      "314 Penny  So?\n",
      "315 |||| [548] Sheldon  They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.\n",
      "316 Penny  Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.)\n",
      "317 |||| [550, 551] Howard  Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.\n",
      "318 Penny  That sounds like fun.\n",
      "319 (sings)  Baby, baby don’t get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don’t get hooked on me.\n",
      "320 |||| [555] Sheldon  I don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you’re a veritable Mack Daddy.\n"
