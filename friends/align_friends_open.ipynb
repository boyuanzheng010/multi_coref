This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n",

And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\n",

      "Yeah?\n",
      "Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\n",
      "Shut up, Joey!\n",
      "So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\n",
      "Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\n",
      "Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\n",
      "Yes, and we're very excited about it.\n",
      "Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\n",
      "Okay, sure.\n",

I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...\n",

      "Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!\n",

There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you!

      "All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...\n",
      "So, like, you guys all have jobs?\n",
      "Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm an actor.\n",
      "Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?\n",
      "I doubt it. Mostly regional work.\n",
      "Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.\n",
      "Look, it was a job all right?\n",
      "'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'\n",
      "I will not take this abuse.\n",
      "You're right, I'm sorry. \"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...\"\n",
      "You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?\n",
      "So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.\n",
      "I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.\n",
      "I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Well, it's like that. With feelings.\n",
      "Oh wow. Are you in trouble.\n",
      "Big time!\n",
      "Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.\n",
      "I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.\n",
      "Oh, look, wish me luck!\n",
      "What for?\n",
      "I'm gonna go get one of those job things.\n",

      "Hey, Monica!\n",
      "Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?\n",
      "You had sex, didn't you?\n",
      "How do you do that?\n",
      "Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?\n",
      "You know Paul?\n",
      "Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.\n",
      "You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?\n",
      "Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.\n",
      "Of course it was a line!\n",
      "Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\n",
      "I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\n",
      "I hate men! I hate men!\n",
      "Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\n",
      "Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\n",
      "All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\n",
      "I just thought he was nice, y'know?\n",
      "I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\n",
      "\n",
      "Guess what?\n",
      "You got a job?\n",
      "Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\n",
      "And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\n",
      "You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\n",
      "Oh, how well you know me...\n",
      "They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\n",
      "How'd you pay for them?\n",
      "Uh, credit card.\n",
      "And who pays for that?\n",
      "Um... my... father.\n",
      "Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\n",
      "C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\n",
      "I know that. That's why I was getting married.\n",
      "Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\n",
      "All right, you ready?\n",
      "No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? \"Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\" Come on, I can't do this!\n",
      "You can, I know you can!\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!\n",
      "C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\n",
      "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\n",
      "Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\n",
      "Rachel! That was a library card!\n",
      "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\n",
      "Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\n",

      "You be okay?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?\n",

      "I knew.\n",
      "You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\n",
      "Yeah, maybe...\n",
      "Okay... okay, maybe I will...\n",
      "Goodnight.\n",
      "Goodnight.\n",

      "Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.\n",
      "There's an image.\n",
      "Would anybody like more coffee?\n",
      "Did you make it, or are you just serving it?\n",
      "I'm just serving it.\n",

      "Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\n",
      "Oh, yeah!\n",
      "Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\n",
      "Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\n",
      "The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\n",
      "Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\n",
      "....Are we still talking about sex?\n",
      "No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\n",
      "Well, she has issues.\n",
      "Does she.\n",
      "He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\n",
      "Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?\n",
      "Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. No.\n",
      "Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\n",
      "Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\n",
      "Sorry. You look good too.\n",
      "Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...\n",
      "A lesbian?\n",
      "Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?\n",
      "Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\n",
      "Why- why are you here, Carol?\n",
      "I'm pregnant.\n",
      "Pregnant?!\n",
      "Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\n",
      "...Then I've already seen this one!\n",
      "Are you through with that?\n",
      "Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\n",
      "Whose little ball of paper is this?!\n",
      "Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!\n",
      "Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\n",
      "Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\n",
      "Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\n",
      "Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\n",
      "That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\n",
      "Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\n",
      "Eeaagh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\n",
      "Yeah, it's beautiful.\n",
      "Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\n",
      "No, look, don't touch that!\n",
      "Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\n",
      "Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!\n",
      "Oh! Yeah!\n",
      "Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\n",
      "Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\n",
      "You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\n",
      "I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\n",
      "...Dinah?\n",
      "Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\n",
      "You didn't.\n",
      "Oh, I am sorry...\n",
      "I gave you one job!\n",
      "Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\n",
      "Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\n",
      "I just... can't do it.\n",
      "Boys? We're going in.\n",
      "\n",
      ".....Hi.\n",
      "Wow. That is not a happy hi.\n",
      "Carol's pregnant.\n",
      "Ooh! I found it!\n",
      "W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\n",
      "Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\n",
      "Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\n",
      "Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\n",
      "Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\n",
      "She is so great! I miss her.\n",
      "What does she mean by 'involved'?\n",
      "I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\n",
      "Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\n",
      "So what are you gonna do?\n",
      "I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\n",
      "\n",
      ".....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n",
      "Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?\n",
      "Curry.\n",
      "Mmmm!\n",
      "I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\n",
      "Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\n",
      "They all had a thing for him.\n",
      "Aw, Mom...\n",
      "I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\n",
      "Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\n",
      "No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\n",
      "Well, they don't have to know that...\n",
      "Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\n",
      "I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\n",
      "\n",
      "What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\n",
      "I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\n",
      "Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\n",
      "What's that supposed to mean?\n",
      "Nothing! It's an expression.\n",
      "No it's not.\n",
      "Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\n",
      "So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\n",
      "Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you knew about this?!\n",
      "Your folks are really that bad, huh?\n",
      "Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\n",
      "Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.\n",
      "Must pee.\n",
      "Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\n",
      "You're twins?\n",
      "Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\n",
      "What does she do?\n",
      "She's a waitress.\n",
      "All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\n",
      "Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\n",
      "Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\n",
      "The lights, please..\n",
      "\n",
      "...How long was I in there?\n",
      "I'm just cleaning up.\n",
      "D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\n",
      "Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\n",
      "Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\n",
      "Oh.. a little..\n",
      "Mm-hmm..\n",
      "A lot.\n",
      "Mm.\n",
      "So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\n",
      "Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\n",
      "Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\n",
      "Got me.\n",
      "Remember when we were in high school together?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?\n",
      "Yes, yes!\n",
      "Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..\n",
      "Me either...\n",
      "Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Ross, you remember Susan.\n",
      "How could I forget?\n",
      "Ross.\n",
      "Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?\n",
      "Dr. Oberman.\n",
      "..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-\n",
      "She.\n",
      "-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?\n",
      "Yes, and she's very supportive.\n",
      "Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Quack, quack..\n",
      "Ross? That opens my cervix.\n",
      "Barry?\n",
      "C'mon in.\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.\n",
      "Huh?!\n",
      "So, how ya doin?\n",
      "I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!\n",
      "Yeah, well..\n",
      "Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.\n",
      "Be right there. Be back in a sec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dumped him.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?\n",
      "Give me a 'for instance'.\n",
      "Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?\n",
      "Marlon-\n",
      "Marlon?!\n",
      "-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.\n",
      "...As in Mouse?\n",
      "As in my grandmother.\n",
      "Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?\n",
      "Julia..\n",
      "We agreed on Minnie.\n",
      "'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?\n",
      "Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?\n",
      "Oh, not much. I-I got a job.\n",
      "Oh, that's great.\n",
      "Why are- why are you so tanned?\n",
      "Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.\n",
      "Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?\n",
      "No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.\n",
      "Me?!\n",
      "No! I went with Mindy.\n",
      "Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!\n",
      "Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.\n",
      "Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!\n",
      "Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.\n",
      "And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!\n",
      "Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.\n",
      "Okay..\n",
      "See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Me.\n",
      "Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.\n",
      "Well, thank you for giving it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello?!\n",
      "Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?\n",
      "Helen Geller? I don't think so.\n",
      "Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "No, I mean it's not Geller.\n",
      "What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?\n",
      "No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.\n",
      "Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?\n",
      "It's my baby too.\n",
      "Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.\n",
      "Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!\n",
      "All right, you two, stop it!\n",
      "No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.\n",
      "Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.\n",
      "Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.\n",
      "Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!\n",
      "My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-\n",
      "Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. A little.\n",
      "Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..\n",
      "You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.\n",

      "Look at that.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Well? Isn't that amazing?\n",
      "What are we supposed to be seeing here?\n",
      "I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.\n",
      "You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.\n",
      "Then don't do that, alright?\n",
      "Okay!\n",
      "Monica. Whaddya think?\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Wh- are you welling up?\n",
      "No.\n",

      "Oh shut up!\n",
      "Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.\n",
      "s01_e03\n",
      "Hi guys!\n",
      "Hey, Pheebs! Hi!\n",
      "Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?\n",
      "Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'\n",
      "Ohh. Ouch.\n",
      "What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?\n",
      "Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.\n",
      "Since when?\n",
      "Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.\n",
      "Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.\n",
      "Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.\n",
      "And everybody knows this?\n",
      "Yeah. Cushions the blow.\n",
      "Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.\n",
      "That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.\n",
      "Uh, Ross.\n",
      "What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!\n",
      "\"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?\"\n",
      "\"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.\"\n",
      "Hey, that was really good!\n",
      "Thanks! Let's keep going.\n",
      "Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\"\n",
      "\"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.\"\n",

      "What?\n",
      "Relax your hand!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so much!\n",
      "Whoah!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Alright, now try taking a puff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.\n",
      "No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.\n",
      "It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.\n",
      "Y'miss it?\n",
      "Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.\n",
      "No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's ridiculous!\n",
      "Can I use.. either thumb?\n",
      "Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah, excellent.\n",
      "Good for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Y'okay, Phoebe?\n",
      "Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.\n",
      "What did they do to you?\n",
      "It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-\n",
      "Easy.\n",
      "- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.\n",
      "Oh, Satan's minions at work again...\n",
      "Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.\n",
      "What are you talking about? Keep it!\n",
      "It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.\n",
      "Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!\n",
      "Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...\n",
      "We're with you. We got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.\n",
      "Chandler, what are you doing?\n",
      "Hey. Whaddya doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! Oh, God!\n",
      "What is this?!\n",
      "I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.\n",
      "Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!\n",
      "And this- is my reward!\n",
      "Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.\n",
      "Okay, so this time I won't quit!\n",
      "Ohhh! Put it out!\n",
      "All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.\n",
      "Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!\n",
      "Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.\n",
      "This Alan again? How's it goin'?\n",
      "'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.\n",
      "So when do we get to meet the guy?\n",
      "Let's see, today's Monday... Never.\n",
      "Oh, come on! Come on!\n",
      "No. Not after what happened with Steve.\n",
      "What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.\n",
      "Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.\n",
      "Well, then can we meet him?\n",
      "Nope. Schhorry.\n",
      "I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.\n",
      "Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.\n",
      "I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.\n",
      "Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..\n",
      "Let it go, Ross.\n",
      "Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.\n",
      "Do you all promise?\n",
      "Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!\n",
      "Chandler? Do you promise to be good?\n",
      "\n",

      "...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.\n",
      "Loved him! Yeah! He's great!\n",
      "Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "And did you notice...?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.\n",
      "Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!\n",
      "...What shoe?\n",
      "From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'\n",
      "\n",
      "...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.\n",
      "What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.\n",
      "Really!\n",
      "Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?\n",
      "You know what I like most about him, though?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "The way he makes me feel about myself.\n",
      "Yeah...\n",
      "Hi.. how was the game?\n",
      "Well..\n",
      "WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!\n",
      "Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?\n",
      "Alan.\n",
      "He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...\n",
      "I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.\n",
      "Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..\n",
      "Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..\n",
      "What?\n",
      "..I dunno, a little too Alan?\n",
      "Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.\n",
      "Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.\n",
      "I personally could have a gallon of Alan.\n",
      "Hey, Lizzie.\n",
      "Hey, Weird Girl.\n",
      "I brought you alphabet soup.\n",
      "Did you pick out the vowels?\n",
      "Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, \"sometimes y\". Uh, I also have something else for you.\n",
      "Saltines?\n",
      "No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?\n",
      "What? Oh my God, there's really money in here.\n",
      "I know.\n",

      "Nooo!\n",

      "Hey, this is so unfair!\n",
      "Oh, why is it unfair?\n",
      "So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?\n",

      "...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?\n",

      "Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!\n",
      "Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.\n",
      "Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!\n",
      "I know.. it's gonna be really hard.\n",
      "Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.\n",
      "No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.\n",
      "Do you have any respect for your body?\n",
      "Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?\n",
      "Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.\n",
      "Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.\n",
      "Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!\n",

      "Hey. Where's Joey?\n",
      "Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?\n",
      "I think he's across the hall.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "There y'go.\n",
      "Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.\n",
      "Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?\n",
      "Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?\n",
      "Hey, I might!\n",
      "Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.\n",
      "You're kidding. Oh my God.\n",
      "And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.\n",
      "Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..\n",
      "Uh, Joey..\n",
      "Oh, God!\n",
      "Okay..\n",

      "Alright, we have to talk.\n",
      "There it is!\n",
      "Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there somebody else?\n",
      "No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.\n",
      "We didn't change..\n",
      "So that's it? It's over? Just like that?\n",
      "You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-\n",

      "Okay!\n",
      "-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!\n",

      "Are you guys gonna be okay?\n",
      "Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I'm, I'm really sorry.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.\n",
      "Relieved?\n",
      "Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.\n",
      "Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.\n",
      "Yeah. He could row like a viking.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Mmm.\n",
      "So how'd it go?\n",
      "Oh, y'know..\n",

      "Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!\n",
      "Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?\n",

      "I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?\n",
      "God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.\n",

      "That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.\n",
      "They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?\n",

      "Floopy?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.\n",
      "Oh, like that's a word.\n",
      "Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?\n",
      "...Pheebs?\n",
      "Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.\n",
      "Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?\n",

      "Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'\n",
      "Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!\n",
      "Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?\n",
      "Yeah, that sounds about right.\n",
      "Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?\n",
      "And-and a power tie?\n",
      "No, pretty much just a towel.\n",
      "Oh God.\n",

      "White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?\n",
      "Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!\n",
      "Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.\n",
      "Please tell me it's his mother.\n",
      "Definitely not his mother.\n",
      "Oh, no...\n",

      "Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!\n",
      "Light still out?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh. Maybe they're- napping.\n",
      "Oh please, they're having sex.\n",
      "Shut up!\n",
      "So, whaddya think George is like?\n",
      "I think he's shy.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.\n",
      "I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.\n",
      "Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?\n",
      "He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.\n",
      "Look, it's just a little more complicated...\n",
      "Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?\n",
      "Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...\n",
      "Then what?\n",
      "My first time with Carol was...\n",
      "What?\n",
      "It was my first time.\n",
      "With Carol? Oh.\n",

      "Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!\n",
      "Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!\n",
      "Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.\n",
      "What?! You slept with Jason?\n",
      "You'd already broken up.\n",
      "How long?\n",
      "A couple hours.\n",
      "Oh, that's nice!\n",
      "Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.\n",
      "Excuse me?!\n",
      "Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.\n",
      "Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!\n",
      "I was laughing! You made me laugh!\n",
      "There he is! There he is!\n",
      "Where?\n",
      "Right- where we've been looking all night!\n",
      "He is so cute!\n",
      "Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!\n",
      "Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww.\n",
      "Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?\n",
      "I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..\n",
      "Hey, buddy.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Oh, that's attractive.\n",
      "Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.\n",
      "Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?\n",
      "Oh, ah- the kid has it.\n",
      "The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.\n",
      "I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.\n",
      "You gotta do it, man.\n",
      "Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!\n",
      "No! No!\n",
      "Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!\n",
      "GIVE ME MY PUCK!!\n",
      "...Now that was fun.\n",
      "Okay, Monica: Right foot red.\n",
      "Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks.\n",

      "Alright. Yes, this is Rachel.\n",
      "Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.\n",
      "Green. To the green.\n",
      "I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.\n",
      "To the left, to the left- aww!\n",
      "Ohhh... I'm fine.\n",
      "s01_e05\n",
      "Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.\n",
      "Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?\n",
      "Come on! You guys can pee standing up.\n",
      "We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.\n",
      "Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.\n",
      "Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple orgasms!\n",
      "So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!\n",
      "No plans, huh?\n",
      "Not a one.\n",
      "Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?\n",
      "Oh, right, right, shut up.\n",
      "Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.\n",
      "No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.\n",
      "Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.\n",
      "You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.\n",
      "Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.\n",
      "No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.\n",
      "Tony?\n",
      "Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?\n",
      "Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.\n",
      "Does anybody want anything else?\n",
      "Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.\n",
      "What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?\n",
      "It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.\n",
      "That guy, he burns me up.\n",
      "Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.\n",
      "Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.\n",
      "Did he give you that whole \"You're-not-up-to-this\" thing again?\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \"You'll never make it on your own\".\n",
      "Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, Joey.\n",
      "My god, Angela.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.\n",
      "Are you gonna go over there?\n",
      "No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.\n",
      "Joey.\n",
      "You look good.\n",
      "That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.\n",
      "You don't say.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?\n",
      "Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.\n",
      "Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?\n",
      "Who?\n",
      "Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?\n",
      "Don't you have a laundry room in your building?\n",
      "Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.\n",
      "Bob? Who the hell's Bob?\n",
      "Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...\n",
      "Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.\n",
      "Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "We're just friends.\n",
      "Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?\n",
      "What four of us?\n",
      "You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.\n",
      "Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.\n",
      "Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.\n",
      "Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...\n",
      "Oh, god help us.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!\n",
      "Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.\n",
      "What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.\n",
      "I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?\n",
      "Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.\n",
      "Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?\n",
      "It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.\n",
      "It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.\n",
      "Nuh-uh.\n",
      "Yuh-huh.\n",
      "So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?\n",
      "Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?\n",
      "Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Which?\n",
      "Which what?\n",
      "You've never met Bob, have you?\n",
      "No, but he's...\n",
      "Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, Joey.\n",
      "...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.\n",
      "Where are they? Where are they?\n",
      "This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.\n",
      "It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.\n",
      "Eww, I don't wanna do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we go.\n",
      "Ok, have a good break-up.\n",
      "Hey, Janice.\n",
      "Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.\n",
      "Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?\n",
      "We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...\n",
      "\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What... did you get me there?\n",
      "I got you...these.\n",
      "Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.\n",
      "Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?\n",

      "That's it?\n",
      "Yeah, it was really hard.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.\n",
      "Ok, you weren't there.\n",
      "Comin' through. Move, move.\n",
      "Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.\n",
      "Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.\n",
      "But I saved it. I put my basket on top.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "No suds, no save. Ok?\n",
      "\n",
      "What's goin' on?\n",
      "Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.\n",
      "Was your basket on top?\n",
      "Yeah, but, there were no suds.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "Well, you know, no suds, no save.\n",
      "No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.\n",
      "Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.\n",
      "Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.\n",
      "\n",

      "Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?\n",
      "Rach, have you never done this before?\n",
      "Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.\n",
      "Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.\n",
      "Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?\n",
      "Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.\n",
      "He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?\n",
      "Brooklyn Heights.\n",
      "Cleveland.\n",
      "How, how did that happen?\n",

      "So, you and Angela, huh?\n",
      "Yep. Pretty much.\n",
      "You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.\n",
      "Huh, I never really noticed.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.\n",
      "Monica, Monica is great.\n",
      "Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.\n",
      "I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.\n",

      "It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.\n",
      "You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.\n",
      "Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.\n",
      "Huh. That's nice.\n",
      "Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.\n",

      "Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.\n",
      "That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.\n",
      "What uh-oh?\n",
      "Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.\n",

      "Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.\n",
      "Come on, show me.\n",
      "All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.\n",
      "Oh, everything's pink.\n",
      "Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.\n",
      "Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!\n",

      "Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?\n",
      "Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!\n",
      "Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?\n",
      "No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.\n",

      "Uh-oh...\n",
      "How-how did that happen?\n",
      "I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.\n",
      "I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.\n",

      "Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.\n",
      "I could do that.\n",
      "Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.\n",
      "Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.\n",
      "Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...\n",

      "Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.\n",
      "Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!\n",
      "You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?\n",

      "Oh, you got the whole night, huh?\n",
      "Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..\n",
      "Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?\n",
      "No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?\n",

      "Well, I'm- I'm showering.\n",
      "No, that was clenching.\n",
      "Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.\n",
      "I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?\n",

      "...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'\n",

      "Hard to tell, I was naked.\n",
      "No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.\n",

      "If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!\n",

      "The doctor says it's a matter of hours.\n",
      "How-how are you, Mom?\n",
      "Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What's different?\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Oh, maybe that's it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is unbelievable, our mother is...\n",
      "Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.\n",
      "Oh God!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.\n",
      "Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.\n",
      "Not just restaurants, from our house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Geller?\n",
      "\n",
      "She looks so small.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.\n",
      "G'bye, Nana.\n",
      "Bye, Nana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ross!\n",
      "\n",
      "What is going on?!\n",
      "Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..\n",
      "What?\n",
      "She's not- past, she's present, she's back.\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "She may have died.\n",
      "She may have died?\n",
      "We're looking into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, uh, I'll go see.\n",
      "This almost never happens!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she's passed.\n",
      "I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?\n",
      "Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.\n",
      "Yeah, you have homosexual hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, um, did she...\n",
      "Twice.\n",
      "Twice?\n",
      "Oh, that sucks!\n",
      "You guys okay?\n",
      "I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...\n",
      "Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.\n",
      "Nono, she's gone.\n",
      "We checked. A lot.\n",
      "Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.\n",
      "Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.\n",
      "Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?\n",
      "Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.\n",
      "I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.\n",
      "Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweetie, you think you can get in there?\n",
      "I don't see why not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my retainer!\n",
      "I was just thinking. When my time comes-\n",
      "Dad!\n",
      "Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.\n",
      "You what?\n",
      "I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.\n",
      "Define fun.\n",
      "C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...\n",
      "...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.\n",
      "Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.\n",
      "That's probably what they'll say.\n",
      "I'd like that.\n",
      "Hey, gorgeous.\n",
      "Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-\n",
      "No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.\n",
      "Oh! Okay! Phew!\n",
      "So, uh... what do you think it is about me?\n",
      "I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...\n",
      "...Quality, right, great.\n",
      "Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.\n",
      "Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?\n",
      "What? He's cute!\n",
      "Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.\n",
      "Is Brian...?\n",
      "No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.\n",
      "Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.\n",
      "Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.\n",
      "This one?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.\n",
      "You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.\n",
      "You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.\n",
      "Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.\n",
      "Wait! We need shoes!\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. Um, how about these?\n",
      "That's really a day shoe.\n",
      "And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?\n",
      "Could we see something in a slimmer heel?\n",
      "Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.\n",
      "No, it really should be burgundy.\n",
      "Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?\n",
      "No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh my God..\n",
      "Is everything all right, dear?\n",
      "Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "How we doing, you guys ready?\n",
      "Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?\n",
      "Some days it's all I can think about.\n",
      "Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.\n",
      "Oh, you-you mean your earrings?\n",
      "What'd I say?\n",
      "Hm-m.\n",
      "Are these the shoes?\n",
      "Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.\n",
      "What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?\n",
      "Morning. We ready to go?\n",
      "Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a really beautiful service.\n",
      "It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.\n",
      "Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.\n",
      "You're watching a football game at a funeral?\n",
      "No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.\n",
      "You are a frightening, frightening man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!\n",
      "Oh, I hope they're not ruined.\n",
      "God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!\n",
      "I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-\n",
      "God! Ross!\n",
      "I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...\n",
      "Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.\n",
      "What, what is it?\n",
      "You missed a belt loop.\n",
      "Oh! No-n-\n",
      "Okay, it's in spasm.\n",
      "Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, no-\n",
      "Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.\n",
      "Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?\n",
      "I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.\n",
      "Wow, those pills really worked, huh?\n",
      "Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...\n",
      "Ooh! That's so nice...\n",
      "...Chandler!\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.\n",
      "You were right.\n",
      "Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.\n",
      "Oh, well you know who I love the most?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "You!\n",
      "Oh.. you don't get it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Whaddya got there?\n",
      "Just a, uh... hearing disability.\n",
      "What's the score?\n",
      "Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.\n",
      "Beautiful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?\n",
      "Your grandmother would have hated this.\n",
      "Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.\n",
      "No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.\n",
      "That sounds like Nana.\n",
      "Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?\n",
      "...I can imagine.\n",
      "I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.\n",
      "That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?\n",
      "Tell her what?\n",
      "How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.\n",
      "I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.\n",
      "Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?\n",
      "...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "More wine, dear?\n",
      "Oh, I think so.\n",
      "Those earrings look really lovely on you.\n",
      "Thank you. They're yours.\n",
      "Actually they were Nana's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.\n",
      "Hey, who's this little naked guy?\n",
      "That little naked guy would be me.\n",
      "Aww, look at the little thing.\n",
      "Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?\n",
      "Who are those people?\n",
      "Got me.\n",
      "Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.\n",
      "Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?\n",
      "Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?\n",
      "Looks like a fun gang.\n",
      "Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!\n",
      "Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.\n",
      "Hey, Lowell.\n",
      "Hey, Chandler.\n",
      "So how's it going there in Financial Services?\n",
      "It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?\n",
      "Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.\n",
      "I know. That's what I told her.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So- you can tell?\n",
      "Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.\n",
      "So you don't think I have a, a quality?\n",
      "Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.\n",
      "He is?\n",
      "Yup, and waaay out of your league.\n",
      "Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.\n",
      "s01_e09\n",
      "Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?\n",
      "An advance?\n",
      "It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.\n",
      "Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.\n",
      "Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that.\n",
      "Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?\n",
      "No, they're not.\n",
      "Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.\n",
      "You're wrong.\n",
      "I am not wrong.\n",
      "You're wrong.\n",
      "No, I just talked to them.\n",
      "I'm calling Mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?\n",
      "Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.\n",
      "That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.\n",
      "What were you modeling for?\n",
      "You know those posters for the city free clinic?\n",
      "Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those \"healthy, healthy, healthy guys\"?\n",
      "You know, the asthma guy was really cute.\n",
      "Do you know which one you're gonna be?\n",
      "No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...\n",
      "Good luck, man. I hope you get it.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.\n",
      "Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.\n",
      "Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?\n",
      "You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.\n",
      "Yes, every single one of them.\n",
      "Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?\n",
      "Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.\n",
      "So you're free Thursday, then.\n",
      "Yeah. Oh, can I come?\n",
      "Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?\n",
      "Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.\n",
      "I thought it was $98.50.\n",
      "Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.\n",
      "Well, I'm off to Carol's.\n",
      "Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?\n",
      "Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.\n",
      "Hi, is uh, is Carol here?\n",
      "No, she's at a faculty meeting.\n",
      "Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.\n",
      "Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.\n",
      "What's it look like?\n",
      "Kinda like a big face without skin.\n",
      "Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.\n",
      "Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.\n",
      "Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.\n",
      "Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.\n",
      "Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.\n",
      "The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?\n",
      "What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?\n",
      "You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?\n",
      "Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.\n",
      "Do you uh, do you talk about me?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, all the time.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.\n",
      "Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.\n",
      "Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.\n",
      "I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, Rach, did you make your money?\n",
      "No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.\n",
      "Rach, here's your mail.\n",
      "Thanks, you can just put it on the table.\n",
      "No, here's your mail.\n",
      "Thanks, you can just put it on the table.\n",
      "Would you just open it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.\n",
      "We all chipped in.\n",
      "We did?\n",
      "You owe me 20 bucks.\n",
      "Thank you. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.\n",
      "Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?\n",
      "All right, I'm nine years old.\n",
      "Oh, I hate this story.\n",
      "We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.\n",
      "Oh my god.\n",
      "Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.\n",
      "Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.\n",
      "We did?\n",
      "Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.\n",
      "Get out.\n",
      "I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.\n",
      "Really? You don't know what that means to me.\n",
      "Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?\n",
      "Yeah. Oh.\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "I just remembered, I have to do something.\n",
      "Oh. What?\n",
      "Um, leave.\n",
      "Wait, wait, wait!\n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess you all saw it.\n",
      "Saw what?\n",
      "No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.\n",
      "Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.\n",
      "Tonight, on a very special Blossom.\n",
      "Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?\n",
      "I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.\n",
      "All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.\n",
      "That's closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.\n",
      "Oh, you must stop shooping.\n",
      "Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.\n",
      "Chandler, will you just come in already?\n",
      "No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!\n",
      "Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.\n",
      "That's not a question.\n",
      "But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.\n",
      "All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.\n",
      "Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah!\n",
      "Ok, Mom never hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, all done.\n",
      "What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.\n",

I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",

      "Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.\n",
      "Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\n",
      "What's the matter?\n",
      "Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...\n",

      "I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.\n",
      "Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...\n",
      "Alright. Just keep him away from me.\n",
      "Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.\n",

      "No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?\n",

      "Hey, kids...\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.\n",
      "Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.\n",
      "Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\n",
      "Oh, no. Oh, no.\n",
      "I'm sorry you misunderstood...\n",

      "Oh, will you give me the thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, Max!\n",
      "Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you.\n",
      "Wow.\n",

      "\n",
      "You're going to Minsk.\n",
      "No, I'm... not going to Minsk.\n",
      "Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.\n",

      "Sorry.\n",

      "That's the rule.\n",
      "What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!\n",
      "How'd you get to that?\n",
      "Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio\n",
      "You knew about that?\n",
      "Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.\n",
      "Ok, ok, How about if we split it?\n",
      "What do you mean, like, buy it together?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "You think we're ready for something like that?\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?\n",
      "Why, are you moving out?\n",
      "I'm not moving out.\n",
      "You'd tell me if you were moving out right\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...\n",
      "Aw, I know all about Kip!\n",
      "It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.\n",
      "Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?\n",
      "Aw, don't do that\n",
      "We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.\n",

      "Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!\n",
      "I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....\n",

      "So what's it gonna be?\n",
      "Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!\n",
      "I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!\n",
      "Or an uncle...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey Phoebe!\n",

      "My God.\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "\n",

      "Was it...?\n",
      "Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.\n",
      "Oooooo....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ooo,\" what?\n",
      "Uma Thurman.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "The actress!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks Rach.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what are you gonna do?\n",
      "You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?\n",
      "Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.\n",
      "Feminist issue. That's where I went!\n",
      "She is gonna hate me.\n",
      "Yeah, well...\n",
      "Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?\n",
      "That's patio furniture!\n",
      "So what, like people are gonna come in and think, \"Uh-oh, I'm outside again?\" Of course!\n",
      "What about the birds?\n",
      "I don't know, birds just don't say, \"Hello, sit here, eat something.\"\n",
      "You pick one.\n",
      "All right, how about the ladybugs?\n",
      "Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!\n",
      "Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!\n",
      "Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hi Pheebs!\n",
      "Are you moving out?\n",
      "No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.\n",
      "Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?\n",
      "Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.\n",
      "Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,\n",
      "Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...\n",
      "Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.\n",
      "Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!\n",
      "Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies\n",
      "All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.\n",
      "Which proves that I never lie.\n",
      "I guess you don't.\n",
      "Paolo made a pass at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what do you think?\n",
      "I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.\n",
      "I know!\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?\n",
      "Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!\n",
      "Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you okay?\n",
      "I need some milk.\n",
      "Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?\n",
      "No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \"Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so...\" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!\n",
      "I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!\n",
      "I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!\n",
      "No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?\n",
      "I don't know...right, he's the pig!\n",
      "Such a pig!\n",
      "Oh, God, he's such a pig,\n",
      "Oh he's like a...\n",
      "He's like a big disgusting...\n",
      "...like a...\n",
      "...pig...pig man!\n",
      "Yes, good! Ok...\n",
      "Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?\n",
      "Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...\n",
      "Ok, Ok, Pheebs...\n",
      "The end.\n",
      "Oh, God...\n",
      "Should I not have told you?\n",
      "No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...\n",
      "\n",
      "I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...\n",
      "We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.\n",
      "Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.\n",
      "No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.\n",
      "Come on, two on one.\n",
      "What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!\n",
      "What, now?\n",
      "Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!\n",
      "My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!\n",
      "No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...\n",
      "\n",
      "How's it going?\n",
      "Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, \"How could you?\" or, \"Enormous breasts!\" Here he comes!\n",
      "Ooh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.\n",
      "Oh, ok bye-bye.\n",
      "Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.\n",
      "Grazie.\n",
      "Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...\n",
      "Oh, just look at her...\n",
      "Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...\n",
      "Oh, you're right.\n",
      "...and I really think it should be me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "You all right?\n",
      "Ooh, I've been better...\n",
      "Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.\n",
      "Oh, Ross...\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Oh Ross, you're so great!\n",
      "Ohhhh\n",
      "\n",
      "Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?\n",
      "Oh...\n",
      "You ok?\n",
      "...medium...hmm...any cookies left?\n",
      "Yep!\n",
      "See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.\n",
      "No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want\n",
      "Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.\n",
      "No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I-I'm, I'm having a boy?\n",
      "Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.\n",
      "Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?\n",
      "Yes, you're having a boy!\n",

      "\n",
      "Wha-\n",
      "Wha-\n",
      "What is it?\n",

      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "We already knew that!\n",
      "I'm having a son. Um...\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! And that would be a shut-down!\n",
      "Shut-out!!\n",
      "Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!\n",
      "Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!\n",
      "Yeah, get out!\n",
      "You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.\n",
      "One more game?\n",
      "Oh yeah!\n",
      "s01_e13\n",
      "That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock\n",
      "I'm sorry!\n",
      "You have no respect for anybody's privacy!\n",
      "Rachel, wait, wait.\n",
      "No, you wait! This is ridiculous!\n",
      "Can I just say one thing?\n",
      "What? What?!\n",
      "That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.\n",
      "Oh!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.\n",
      "That's pretty much it.\n",
      "Oops!\n",
      "But you tell it really well, sweetie.\n",
      "Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.\n",
      "Okay. I'll miss you.\n",
      "Isn't he great?\n",
      "He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.\n",
      "I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?\n",
      "So, you think you'll do it on his couch?\n",
      "Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.\n",
      "Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?\n",
      "Oh, yes, could I have one of those.\n",
      "No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Did I, uh, did I miss something?\n",
      "No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.\n",
      "You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?\n",
      "It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.\n",
      "Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?\n",
      "Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.\n",
      "Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.\n",
      "Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.\n",
      "Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.\n",
      "Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.\n",
      "You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.\n",
      "Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?\n",
      "Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.\n",

      "Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!\n",
      "Hey, how long are you in the city?\n",
      "Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.\n",
      "Oh, this is my friend Roger.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.\n",
      "You too, sir.\n",
      "What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?\n",
      "Dad, dad.\n",
      "Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!\n",

      "\n",
      "Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.\n",
      "Sure. So how long you been...\n",
      "Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?\n",
      "Since then?!\n",
      "No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?\n",
      "...I d'know.\n",
      "Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.\n",
      "You're one to talk.\n",
      "Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.\n",
      "Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.\n",
      "Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.\n",
      "It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!\n",
      "I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?\n",
      "What? What?\n",
      "Did you not get a good enough look the other day?\n",
      "Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.\n",
      "Y'know, I don't see that happening?\n",
      "C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.\n",
      "Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'\n",

      "Oh, good. Rog is here.\n",
      "What's the matter with Rog?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\n",
      "What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?\n",
      "I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.\n",
      "Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?\n",
      "I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...\n",
      "Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.\n",
      "Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.\n",
      "That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!\n",
      "Oh! So you think I'm a failure!\n",
      "Isn't he good?\n",
      "Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...\n",
      "Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!\n",
      "Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!\n",
      "\n",
      "You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.\n",
      "That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.\n",
      "Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?\n",
      "Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...\n",
      "Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hate that guy!\n",
      "Night, you guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\n",
      "Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?\n",
      "Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.\n",
      "I'm Joey Tribbiani.\n",
      "Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?\n",
      "Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n",
      "Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.\n",
      "Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.\n",
      "That's a good one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, Joe.\n",
      "Dad, Ronni's here.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?\n",
      "Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.\n",
      "Thank you. Uh...\n",
      "So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\n",
      "Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.\n",
      "I don't want you taking that thing.\n",
      "Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?\n",
      "Who-ah-ho.\n",
      "We'll go to a hotel.\n",
      "We'll go to a hotel.\n",
      "No you won't.\n",
      "No we won't.\n",
      "If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.\n",
      "You're gonna keep an eye on us?\n",
      "That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.\n",
      "Wow. He's strict.\n",
      "Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.\n",
      "Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.\n",
      "C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\"\n",
      "Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.\n",
      "What kinda change?\n",
      "Well, either you break it off with Ronni\n",
      "I can't do that!\n",
      "Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!\n",
      "Yeah, but this is\n",
      "I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!\n",
      "Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\n",
      "Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.\n",
      "Well, you're gonna.\n",
      "I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...\n",
      "Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\n",
      "Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...\n",
      "Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"\n",
      "You really think so?\n",
      "Yeah. I really do.\n",
      "Thanks, Chandler.\n",
      "Get off!\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hi...May I help you?\n",
      "Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?\n",
      "Okay...who are you?\n",
      "Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?\n",
      "Oh, c'mon in.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Hi, I'm Rachel.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Bathroom's up there.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?\n",
      "Oh, like, uh, five minutes?\n",
      "Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.\n",
      "Hey. Morning, dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the matter with you?!\n",
      "I thought it was Chandler!\n",
      "What? What?\n",
      "You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!\n",
      "Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.\n",
      "Hey, Pheebs.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "How's it going?\n",
      "Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what's going on?\n",
      "Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.\n",
      "I dunno, there's just something about...\n",
      "Basically we just feel that he's...\n",
      "We hate that guy.\n",
      "Yeah. Hate him.\n",
      "We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.\n",
      "Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?\n",
      "...No, we hate him.\n",
      "We're sorry.\n",
      "Ma! What're you doing here?\n",
      "I came to give you this and this.\n",
      "Oww! Big ring!\n",
      "Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.\n",
      "Hold on, you-you knew?\n",
      "Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\n",
      "So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\n",
      "Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.\n",
      "Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?\n",
      "Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.\n",
      "I'm...happy...for you?\n",
      "Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.\n",
      "Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.\n",
      "I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?\n",
      "Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.\n",
      "That's sweet. Could I take her?\n",
      "With this ring? No contest.\n",
      "What's wrong, sweetie?\n",
      "Nothing, nothing.\n",
      "Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.\n",
      "It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.\n",
      "Oh. They don't.\n",
      "But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Intense and creepy.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But I don't. Me, Phoebe.\n",
      "Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.\n",
      "You're not? See, that's why you're so great!\n",
      "Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.\n",
      "So you talked to your dad, huh.\n",
      "Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.\n",
      "So Joey, you okay?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.\n",
      "Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\n",
      "If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey, Pheebs.\n",
      "How's it going?\n",
      "Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\n",
      "Awww.\n",
      "Yeah, right.\n",
      "Aaawwwwww!!\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!\n",
      "Hey, Joey. What's going on?\n",
      "Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.\n",
      "Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\n",
      "Sorry. Wrong boobies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, Joey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh! ...Hello, dear.\n",
      "s01_e14\n",
      "I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.\n",
      "She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.\n",
      "Any contact?\n",
      "She lent me an egg once.\n",
      "You're in!\n",
      "Aw, right.\n",
      "Hi, Ross.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...\n",
      "Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.\n",
      "An egg?\n",
      "Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, \"Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.\"\n",
      "I think it's winning.\n",
      "I think it's insane.\n",
      "She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think it'll work?\n",
      "No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.\n",
      "You can not do this.\n",
      "Do what, do what?\n",
      "Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.\n",
      "No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?\n",
      "'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!\n",
      "But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.\n",
      "Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?\n",
      "Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.\n",
      "Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...\n",
      "No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.\n",
      "Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\n",
      "Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.\n",
      "Hi. She said yes.\n",
      "Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?\n",
      "How do I look?\n",
      "Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.\n",
      "Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.\n",
      "...And what did you bring?\n",
      "She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.\n",
      "Janice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh.... my.... God.\n",
      "Hey, it's Janice.\n",
      "Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.\n",
      "No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.\n",
      "Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!\n",
      "Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.\n",
      "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!\n",
      "Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.\n",
      "Which one was Pete Carney?\n",
      "Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. \"Was it good for you?\"\n",
      "Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy. \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.\n",
      "How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!\n",
      "I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.\n",
      "I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.\n",
      "There's more beer, right?\n",
      "Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.\n",
      "Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.\n",
      "Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.\n",
      "Ok, well, what kind of ritual?\n",
      "Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.\n",
      "Or?\n",
      "Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.\n",
      "Burning's good.\n",
      "Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.\n",
      "You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.\n",
      "Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?\n",
      "By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.\n",
      "That's OK.\n",
      "Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can't do that.\n",
      "What? What can't you do?\n",
      "Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Uh, we might be leaving now.\n",
      "Tell me it's \"you and me\" we.\n",
      "She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.\n",
      "Ok, you can not do this to me.\n",
      "You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.\n",
      "Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?\n",
      "I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.\n",
      "I hope she throws up on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "So...\n",
      "Just us.\n",
      "Oh, what a crappy night!\n",
      "Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.\n",
      "Excuse me. How ya doin'?\n",
      "So, do we have the best friends or what?\n",
      "Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?\n",
      "I will go for that drink.\n",
      "You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?\n",
      "Each.\n",
      "That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...\n",
      "Happy Valentine's Day!\n",
      "Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?\n",
      "No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.\n",
      "Kiss me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Chandler, sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.\n",
      "Hi, Monica.\n",
      "Ok, well, this was very special.\n",
      "Rach, come see who's out here!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh my god. Janice, hi!\n",
      "Janice is gonna go away now.\n",
      "I'll be right back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Joey, look who it is.\n",
      "Whoa.\n",
      "Oh, good, Joey's home now.\n",
      "This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.\n",
      "Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?\n",
      "I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's funny. Who are they?\n",
      "The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.\n",
      "You mean they're lovers.\n",
      "If you wanna put a label on it.\n",
      "Wow, uh, anything else I should know?\n",
      "Nope, nope, that's it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!\n",
      "Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.\n",
      "All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.\n",
      "Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.\n",
      "Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.\n",
      "Can we just start throwing things in?\n",
      "Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.\n",
      "Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.\n",
      "Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.\n",
      "Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.\n",
      "Hey he's wearing a sweater.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Eww!\n",
      "And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.\n",
      "Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?\n",
      "I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.\n",
      "Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, funny Valentine.\n",
      "Hi, Just Janice.\n",
      "Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't do it, I will.\n",
      "So, um, what do you do for a living?\n",
      "Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.\n",
      "Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.\n",
      "I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?\n",
      "Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.\n",
      "Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!\n",
      "What do we got there?\n",
      "A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!\n",
      "You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.\n",
      "It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.\n",
      "You're our third call tonight.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.\n",
      "I brought you something.\n",
      "Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.\n",
      "I had them made special.\n",
      "Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "It is?\n",
      "Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.\n",
      "Oh no, you see, actually it is.\n",
      "No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.\n",
      "Oh, no I don't.\n",
      "Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?\n",
      "I did, but...\n",
      "You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.\n",
      "\n",
      "Call me!\n",
      "It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.\n",
      "You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?\n",
      "Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.\n",
      "Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.\n",
      "That could be it.\n",
      "Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.\n",
      "Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny\n",
      "No, it's just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, I love you too. But...\n",
      "No but, no but.\n",
      "You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.\n",
      "That's easy for you to say, you found one already.\n",
      "All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not her.\n",
      "We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?\n",
      "So, um, will you bring the truck?\n",

      "They're nice guys.\n",
      "Oh, they're firemen guys.\n",
      "You guys tell them you were married?\n",

      "Chandler.\n",
      "Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.\n",
      "Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.\n",
      "Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.\n",
      "Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Never mind. But it was going to be really good.\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.\n",
      "That's great!\n",
      "So.... I quit.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!\n",
      "Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.\n",
      "If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.\n",
      "So was it a lot more money?\n",
      "It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "... the WENUS?\n",
      "Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.\n",
      "Oh. That WENUS.\n",
      "So what're you going to do?\n",
      "I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.\n",
      "Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.\n",
      "Um... hi there.\n",
      "Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....\n",
      "Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah!\n",
      "Well, what kind of food is he looking for?\n",
      "Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.\n",
      "Oh my God!\n",
      "Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?\n",
      "Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.\n",
      "OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!\n",
      "Can you see my nipples through this shirt?\n",
      "No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.\n",
      "Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?\n",
      "Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the \"a-gogo.\"\n",
      "Career counselor?\n",
      "Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.\n",
      "I don't!\n",
      "Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.\n",
      "Ah, the lesser-known \"I don't have a dream\" speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, I love my life, I love my life!\n",
      "Ooh! Brian's Song!\n",
      "The meeting with the guy went great?\n",
      "So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.\n",
      "Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?\n",
      "So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.\n",
      "What are you going to make?\n",
      "Yummy noises.\n",
      "And Monica, what are you going to make?\n",
      "I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!\n",
      "Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.\n",
      "Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?\n",
      "How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.\n",
      "OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?\n",
      "Who are you going out with?\n",
      "Oh, is this the bug lady?\n",
      "Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.\n",
      "Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.\n",
      "So what are you guys going to do?\n",
      "Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.\n",
      "And he's not speaking metaphorically.\n",
      "So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?\n",
      "Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.\n",
      "I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.\n",
      "Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...\n",
      "I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...\n",
      "Alright...\n",
      "OK, try this salmon mousse.\n",
      "Mmmm. Good.\n",
      "Is it better than the other salmon mousse?\n",
      "It's creamier.\n",
      "Yeah, well, is that better?\n",
      "I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?\n",
      "\n",
      "My God! What happened to you?\n",
      "Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\"\n",
      "That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!\n",
      "Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.\n",
      "Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!\n",
      "Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.\n",
      "Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.\n",
      "It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.\n",
      "Well.... it is amouz-ing...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.\n",
      "Ten dollars an hour for what?\n",
      "Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.\n",
      "Waitressing?\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...\n",
      "But, but?\n",
      "But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.\n",
      "Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.\n",
      "You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?\n",
      "Talk to me.\n",
      "OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...\n",
      "No no no. Talk... dirty.\n",
      "Wha... what, here?\n",
      "Yes...\n",
      "Ah....\n",
      "Say something..... hot.\n",
      "Er.... um.....\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Um... uh.... vulva.\n",
      "Vulva?\n",
      "Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.\n",
      "Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??\n",
      "Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?\n",
      "What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.\n",
      "Please be kidding.\n",
      "Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.\n",
      "OK. I'm in my apartment...\n",
      "....yeah... what else?\n",
      "That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.\n",
      "Alright, look, I'll start, OK?\n",
      "Joey, please.\n",
      "Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Alright, now you say something.\n",
      "I... ahem... I really don't think so.\n",
      "Come on! You like this woman, right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You want to see her again, right?\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!\n",
      "OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.\n",
      "Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.\n",
      "Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.\n",
      "There you go! Keep going. Keep going!\n",
      "I, er...\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to take my tongue... and...\n",
      "\n",
      "....and....\n",
      "Say it... say it!\n",
      "...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...\n",
      "\n",
      "....with??\n",
      "Funny story!\n",
      "You're not going to believe this!\n",
      "It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.\n",
      "Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.\n",
      "Again?\n",
      "And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.\n",
      "Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!\n",
      "Well?\n",
      "Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.\n",
      "Look at this!\n",
      "Oh! You have a window!\n",
      "Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...\n",
      "Oh look! That guy's peeing!\n",
      "OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Helen, that'll be all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last time I do that, I promise.\n",
      "Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!\n",
      "Who was that?\n",
      "Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.\n",
      "Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.\n",
      "Ten dollars an hour.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Twelve dollars an hour.\n",
      "Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.\n",
      "You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.\n",
      "Done.\n",
      "Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?\n",
      "Hi Steve!\n",
      "Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.\n",
      "This is Rachel.\n",
      "Yeah, OK.\n",
      "Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.\n",
      "It's a lovely apartment.\n",
      "Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?\n",
      "I was just being polite, but, alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's up?\n",
      "In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?\n",
      "OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.\n",
      "Is it dry in here?\n",
      "Let me, let me get you some wine!\n",
      "Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.\n",
      "Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!\n",
      "I'm so glad you liked them!\n",
      "Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!\n",
      "Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.\n",
      "Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.\n",
      "Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?\n",
      "You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.\n",
      "You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.\n",
      "Hey! Sugar-O's!\n",
      "You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...\n",
      "Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!\n",
      "No, we don't.\n",
      "Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.\n",
      "Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Give them to me.\n",
      "Alright, we'll share.\n",
      "No, give me the...\n",
      "Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! \"Help! I'm drowning! Help!\"\n",
      "That's it! Dinner is over!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "What a tool!\n",
      "You don't want to work for a guy like that.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.\n",
      "Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.\n",
      "Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, er... how did it go with Celia?\n",
      "Oh, I was unbelievable.\n",
      "All right, Ross!\n",
      "I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.\n",
      "Whoa! And the... huh-huh?\n",
      "Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...\n",
      "You cuddled.\n",
      "Yeah, which was nice.\n",
      "You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?\n",
      "Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?\n",
      "Yeah, where the hell is he?\n",
      "Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....\n",
      "How's this?\n",
      "Eeeee!\n",
      "Sorry. How about over here?\n",
      "Aaaaah!\n",
      "See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?\n",
      "No.\n",

      "Aaaaahhh!!\n",
      "There you go!\n",
      "s01_e16\n",

      "Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, \"Excuse me, hello Miss,\" so now Im here.\n",
      "No, no... how come you are working here?\n",
      "Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.\n",
      "Can we start over?\n",
      "Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.\n",
      "No, no, no!\n",
      "I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, \"supposedly\" by accident.\n",
      "No, yeah, Ive done that.\n",
      "And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.\n",

      "Youre kidding? She seems so...\n",
      "Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.\n",
      "Thats unbelievable.\n",
      "And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.\n",

      "Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.\n",
      "Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.\n",
      "Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.\n",
      "I am?\n",
      "Sure, why not?\n",
      "Oh my god! Youre amazing!\n",
      "Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?\n",

      "Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?\n",
      "Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.\n",
      "Oh... Oh, Pheebs.\n",
      "I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...\n",

      "Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.\n",
      "What are you crazy? That's a baby!\n",
      "He should take the sack?\n",
      "Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.\n",
      "Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.\n",

      "No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.\n",
      "Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?\n",

      "Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.\n",
      "Marcel?\n",
      "My uncle Marcel.\n",
      "Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?\n",
      "Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?\n",
      "Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?\n",
      "Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?\n",
      "Yes, but there isn't always time!\n",
      "Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.\n",

      "No, none at all.\n",
      "None.\n",

      "Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!\n",
      "Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?\n",

      "We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.\n",

      "Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.\n",
      "Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...\n",

      "Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?\n",
      "It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.\n",
      "Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.\n",
      "Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...\n",
      "Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...\n",
      "Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?\n",
      "That'd be good.\n",
      "Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...\n",

      "Eh. I thought that was an alp.\n",
      "Well, high school was not my favourite time.\n",
      "I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.\n",
      "Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.\n",

      "I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.\n",
      "Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!\n",

      "How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!\n",
      "I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...\n",
      "So have you called her yet?\n",
      "Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?\n",
      "Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.\n",

      "Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!\n",
      "Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.\n",
      "Her answer machine?\n",
      "No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.\n",
      "So, uh, why didn't you say anything?\n",
      "Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"\n",
      "Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!\n",
      "Okay, okay, what's going on?\n",
      "Okay, they're just talking...\n",
      "Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?\n",
      "No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!\n",
      "What? What? What?!\n",
      "That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!\n",
      "And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.\n",
      "Oh!... Right!\n",
      "Hey Rach!\n",
      "How'd it go?\n",
      "Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...\n",
      "Not a good day for birds...\n",
      "Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...\n",
      "That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?\n",
      "Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!\n",
      "That's, that's nice twice!\n",
      "Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?\n",
      "Duh, where've you been?\n",
      "Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "I have my reasons.\n",
      "Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?\n",
      "All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!\n",
      "Wow... Wow!\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.\n",
      "Nooo, it wasn't.\n",
      "Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...\n",
      "Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!\n",
      "That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!\n",
      "Hey, I've been honing!\n",
      "What was with the dishes?\n",
      "Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.\n",
      "Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!\n",
      "Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!\n",
      "Great, now he's waving back.\n",
      "Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!\n",
      "What kinda stuff?\n",
      "Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.\n",
      "You cook naked?\n",
      "Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.\n",
      "What's the matter?\n",
      "Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.\n",
      "No, it was. It was very very good.\n",
      "Well, what about Mindy?\n",
      "Oh, way, way better than Mindy.\n",
      "No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?\n",
      "Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.\n",
      "No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.\n",
      "Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.\n",
      "Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.\n",
      "Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..\n",
      "We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.\n",

      "I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I use your phone?\n",
      "Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?\n",
      "Maybe she never got your message.\n",
      "Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.\n",
      "Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...\n",
      "...desperate, needy, pathetic?\n",
      "Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many beeps?\n",
      "She answered.\n",
      "Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.\n",
      "I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! Hi!\n",
      "How'd he take it?\n",
      "Pretty well, actually...\n",

      "Oh, do I?\n",
      "Uh huh.\n",
      "We ended up having sex in his chair.\n",
      "You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?\n",
      "You-you had what?\n",
      "Sex in his chair.\n",
      "What, uh... what were you thinking?\n",
      "I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.\n",
      "No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!\n",
      "Please. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,\" what would you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "If it helps, I could slide over.\n",
      "It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.\n",
      "Where are you going?\n",
      "I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello? Hello?\n",

      "So how's Mindy?\n",
      "Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!\n",
      "Brrrrrrr!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hell is filled with people like you.\n",
      "He's back! The peeper's back!\n",

      "Get down!\n",
      "Get down?\n",
      "...And boogie!\n",
      "Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.\n",
      "Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.\n",
      "Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..\n",
      "..Naughty!\n",
      "Right, I'll see you guys later...\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?\n",
      "Why don't you just take it with you?\n",
      "Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?\n",
      "Why don't you just call her?\n",
      "I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.\n",
      "Do you?\n",
      "No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...\n",

Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Will you be my maid of honour?\n",
      "Of course!\n",

      "Um, what- what would make you think that?\n",
      "Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.\n",
      "Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.\n",
      "Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!\n",
      "What? What's what you were afraid of?\n",
      "Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said \"Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,\" and now I feel so stupid.\n",
      "Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",

      "Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.\n",
      "Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?\n",
      "Nngghhh!!!!!!!\n",
      "Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.\n",

      "Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally..\n",
      "Joey!!\n",
      "Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.\n",
      "The green dress? Really?\n",
      "Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.\n",
      "Nooo!\n",
      "Hey. Got a second?\n",
      "Sure, sure. Come on... ...in...\n",
      "Hello, sweetheart.\n",
      "Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?\n",
      "Uh, we are here to break up with you.\n",
      "Both of you?\n",
      "Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.\n",
      "I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!\n",
      "Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?\n",
      "....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.\n",
      "Even when we were having sex in that chair?\n",
      "I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.\n",
      "Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!\n",
      "You did it twice?\n",
      "Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.\n",
      "Okay...\n",
      "Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.\n",
      "Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.\n",
      "What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!\n",

      "I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?\n",
      "And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.\n",
      "You okay?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.\n",

      "Big day.\n",
      "All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...\n",

      "Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.\n",
      "Hi. Hi.\n",
      "What are you doing here?\n",
      "Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.\n",
      "...I'm, I'm okay.\n",
      "Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?\n",
      "That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...\n",
      "You got it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?\n",
      "I have no idea. But look how much they spent!\n",
      "Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.\n",
      "I know. It's just such reckless spending.\n",
      "I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.\n",
      "Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.\n",
      "That's me.\n",
      "Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!\n",
      "Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-\n",
      "Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.\n",
      "Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.\n",
      "What? It's, it's just a phase.\n",
      "Well, that's what we said about Joey...\n",
      "Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.\n",
      "Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.\n",
      "Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.\n",
      "This woman's living my life.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.\n",
      "You're not an artist.\n",
      "Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.\n",
      "Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.\n",
      "Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.\n",
      "Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...\n",
      "Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?\n",
      "Nooo...\n",
      "This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.\n",
      "How about Joey... Pepponi?\n",
      "No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.\n",
      "Joey... Switzerland?\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.\n",

      "Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.\n",
      "Well, it does not ring a bell with me...\n",
      "Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.\n",
      "Might wanna try Joseph.\n",

      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.\n",
      "What are you doing?\n",
      "Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.\n",
      "What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?\n",
      "This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.\n",
      "Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.\n",
      "This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.\n",
      "What d'you think?\n",
      "Lotsa things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which one do you think she is?\n",
      "\n",
      "May I help you?\n",
      "Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.\n",
      "You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.\n",
      "What does she mean?\n",
      "I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon.\n",
      "Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?\n",
      "People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!\n",
      "She could be you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I'm not getting this!\n",
      "I'm totally getting it!\n",
      "Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?\n",
      "\n",
      "What? You just click when they click.\n",
      "Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.\n",
      "Great. It's gym class all over again.\n",
      "Aww.\n",
      "Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.\n",
      "Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?\n",
      "She's your partner.\n",
      "Hi. I'm Monica.\n",
      "Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.\n",
      "Monana?\n",
      "Yeah. It's Dutch.\n",
      "You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.\n",
      "Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.\n",
      "And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Where've you been?\n",
      "At the vet.\n",
      "She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?\n",
      "She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.\n",
      "Hey! He beat ya.\n",
      "She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.\n",
      "So what does this mean?\n",
      "I'm gonna have to give him up.\n",
      "I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!\n",
      "I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?\n",
      "I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.\n",
      "Isn't there any way you can keep him?\n",
      "No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.\n",
      "How do you get a monkey into a zoo?\n",
      "I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.\n",
      "Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.\n",
      "Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey. We found her, we found the girl.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Did you call the cops?\n",
      "Nope. We took her to lunch.\n",
      "Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.\n",
      "What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.\n",
      "Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.\n",
      "Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.\n",
      "...Take off their hats!\n",
      "Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.\n",
      "No way. No way did you do this.\n",
      "Monana was very brave.\n",
      "It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!\n",
      "So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...\n",
      "...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!\n",
      "Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.\n",
      "Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.\n",
      "'Scuse me?\n",
      "There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?\n",
      "Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.\n",
      "Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?\n",
      "Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.\n",
      "I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.\n",
      "Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.\n",
      "Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.\n",
      "I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.\n",
      "Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?\n",
      "Oh, somebody will.\n",
      "You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?\n",
      "You're kidding.\n",
      "Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!\n",
      "Y'know, you'd think I would've.\n",
      "Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?\n",
      "...Flame Boy.\n",
      "Where exactly is your zoo?\n",
      "Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Does he, uh, fight with other animals?\n",
      "No-no, he's, he's very docile.\n",
      "Even if he were... cornered?\n",
      "Well I, I don't know. Why?\n",
      "Uh, how is he at handling small objects?\n",
      "He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...\n",
      "How about a hammer, or a small blade?\n",
      "Why- why- why would he need a blade?\n",
      "Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.\n",
      "\n",
      "He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.\n",
      "We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...\n",
      "...He's in.\n",
      "He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!\n",
      "You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.\n",
      "Yo- hooo!\n",
      "Where the hell've you been?\n",
      "Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.\n",
      "Are you drunk?!\n",
      "Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.\n",
      "Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...\n",
      "\n",
      "Monica? Monica!\n",
      "Water rules!\n",
      "Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?\n",
      "Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.\n",
      "Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!\n",
      "No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.\n",
      "Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "They've arrested Monica.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?\n",
      "Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.\n",
      "That I was not expecting.\n",
      "I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.\n",
      "Oh. Thanks.\n",
      "No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!\n",
      "Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.\n",
      "I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?\n",
      "Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?\n",
      "Well, not... worried, just... wondering.\n",
      "There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.\n",
      "Not necessarily...\n",
      "Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.\n",
      "Um, I'm not actually Amish.\n",
      "Really? Then why are you like that?\n",
      "You by the door. In or out?\n",
      "In.\n",
      "You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!\n",
      "Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!\n",
      "This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.\n",
      "Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.\n",
      "Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.\n",
      "I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.\n",
      "Just, just say what you feel.\n",
      "Marcel, I'm hungry.\n",
      "That was good.\n",
      "Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.\n",
      "Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.\n",
      "Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.\n",
      "Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...\n",
      "That's fine, thank you.\n",
      "Next.\n",

      "Shut up!\n",
      "Tell me what?\n",
      "Look at you, you won't even look at him.\n",
      "Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.\n",
      "All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...\n",
      "Doing it on this table.\n",
      "Wow!\n",
      "Exellent dream score.\n",
      "Why, why, why would you dream that?\n",
      "More importantly, was I any good?\n",
      "Well, you were pretty damn good.\n",
      "Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate.\n",
      "Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.\n",
      "I love it, when we share.\n",

      "You're okay there?\n",
      "I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.\n",

      "Hello Rachel.\n",
      "Get off.\n",
      "Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?\n",
      "I don't know. What are you wearing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?\n",
      "Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.\n",
      "Pirates again?\n",
      "No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this \"massage-yourself-at-home-workshop.\" And they are.\n",
      "Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.\n",
      "Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.\n",
      "What... I could, I could do it. What is it?\n",
      "Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story.\n",
      "I could be a secretary.\n",
      "Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.\n",
      "I could do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you playing with?\n",
      "Oh, it's my new beeper.\n",
      "What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?\n",
      "Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'\n",
      "No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.\n",
      "A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.\n",
      "All right, I'll see you guys later.\n",
      "Off to see young Ethan?\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "How young is young Ethan? Young?\n",
      "He's... our age.\n",
      "When we were?\n",
      "Okay, he's a senior in college.\n",
      "College?\n",
      "Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?\n",
      "No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Oh, I can't pass for 22?\n",
      "Well, maybe 25-26.\n",
      "I am 26.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "Can you hear that?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",

      "Well, now, I actually have to get to work.\n",
      "Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there.\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "Bye bye.\n",

      "Yes?\n",
      "Whatcha doin'?\n",
      "Ooh.\n",
      "Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?\n",
      "Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.\n",
      "What?\n",

      "How was that possible?\n",
      "Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.\n",
      "Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.\n",

      "I just had sex.\n",
      "Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?\n",
      "Well, you never told me how old you were.\n",
      "Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?\n",
      "I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...\n",
      "Don't say it.\n",
      "...in love with you.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.\n",
      "Who?\n",
      "Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way.\n",
      "Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.\n",
      "No, forget it.\n",
      "Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?\n",

      "Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?\n",
      "This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...\n",

      "\n",
      "Where have you been?\n",
      "Oh, just had a baby.\n",
      "Mazel tov!\n",

      "No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?\n",
      "No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.\n",
      "Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.\n",
      "No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?\n",
      "I'm a waitress.\n",
      "Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...\n",

      "No, this is a loaner.\n",
      "I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.\n",
      "I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?\n",
      "Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.\n",
      "Yeah, they're not so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.\n",
      "The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.\n",
      "No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?\n",
      "You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.\n",
      "Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.\n",
      "This is so great.\n",
      "You wanna explain that?\n",
      "I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting.\n",
      "Where are they?\n",
      "I'm sure they'll be here soon.\n",
      "Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.\n",
      "Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.\n",
      "You are really frightening me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?\n",
      "All right, ten centimeters, here we go.\n",
      "All right, honey, time to start pushing.\n",
      "But they're not here yet!\n",
      "I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.\n",

      "All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!\n",
      "Good luck!\n",

      "Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.\n",
      "Remembered what?\n",
      "It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!\n",
      "Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?\n",
      "Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.\n",
      "I can't believe he did this.\n",
      "Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n",
      "\n",
      "What did you just say?\n",
      "ahem... um... Crystal duck.\n",

      "I mean, this is unbelievable.\n",
      "I know. This is really, really huge.\n",
      "No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.\n",
      "Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.\n",
      "OK, is there a mute button on this woman?\n",
      "I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?\n",
      "No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?\n",
      "Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.\n",
      "Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.\n",
      "H-He's in China!\n",
      "The country.\n",
      "No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.\n",
      "What about the time difference?\n",
      "From here to the airport?\n",
      "Yes! You're never gonna make it!\n",
      "Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?\n",
      "I-I-I don't know.\n",
      "Well then maybe you shouldn't go.\n",
      "He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.\n",
      "Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.\n",
      "I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.\n",
      "Here, look, alright, does this help?\n",
      "\n",
      "Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.\n",
      "Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright!\n",
      "Ni-chou chi-ma!\n",

      "Hi!\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "May I see your boarding pass?\n",
      "Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.\n",
      "Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.\n",
      "No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...\n",
      "No no no! Federal regulations!\n",
      "OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.\n",
      "Alright. What's the message?\n",
      "Uh... I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.\n",
      ": Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.\n",
      "Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!\n",
      "Heh, heh. It was nothin'.\n",
      "Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!\n",
      "Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.\n",
      "M-Me again?\n",
      "Sure! Why not?\n",
      "Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.\n",
      "How do you mean?\n",
      "I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.\n",
      "Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?\n",

      "Sure.\n",
      "I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.\n",
      "Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!\n",
      "Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.\n",
      "Another good point.\n",
      "No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.\n",

      "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?\n",
      "The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n",
      "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!\n",
      "Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\n",
      "It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.\n",
      "I didn't know you had another level.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",

      "Oh, why?\n",
      "Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...\n",
      "No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!\n",
      "Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...\n",
      "I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.\n",

      "Who is it?\n",
      "It's me, Carl.\n",
      "C'mon up.\n",
      "Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.\n",
      "Seven hundred bucks!\n",
      "Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?\n",
      "Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.\n",
      "Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?\n",
      "What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?\n",
      "I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!\n",

      "\n",
      "Can't do it, can you?\n",
      "So I'm thinking about you. So what?\n",
      "I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?\n",
      "Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....\n",
      "I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!\n",
      "Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.\n",
      "Ross, it's too hard.\n",
      "No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.\n",
      "Ross, you're like my best friend.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "If we broke up, and I lost you...\n",
      "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?\n",
      "Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?\n",
      "No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?\n",
      "I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.\n",
      "Well, start looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!\n",
      "Right! You're right!\n",
      "Heh... y'know?\n",
      "You know what?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.\n",
