'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\", \"Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!\", 'Oh! Yeah!', \"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\", 'Doy! Probably right before she lost it!', \"You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\", 'I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...', '...Dinah?', \"Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\", \"You didn't.\", 'Oh, I am sorry...', 'I gave you one job!', 'Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!', \"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\", \"I just... can't do it.\", \"Boys?

No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\", '', '.....Well, this is still ruined, right?', \"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?\", 'Curry.', 'Mmmm!', \"I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\", \"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\", 'They all had a thing for him.', 'Aw, Mom...', \"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\", \"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\", \"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\", \"Well, they don't have to know that...\", 'Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?', 'Yeah.', \"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\", 'I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\", \"Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\", '', 'And you knew about this?!', 'Your folks are really that bad, huh?', \"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\", \"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.\", 'Must pee.', \"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\", \"You're twins?\", \"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\", 'What does she do?', \"She's a waitress.\", 'All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.', \"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\", 'Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.', 'The lights, please..', '', '...How long was I in there?', \"I'm just cleaning up.\", \"D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\", 'Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!', 'Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?', 'Oh.. a little..', 'Mm-hmm..', 'A lot.', 'Mm.', \"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\", \"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\", \"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\", 'Got me.', 'Remember when we were in high school together?', 'Yeah.', \"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?\", 'Yes, yes!', \"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..\", 'Me either...', \"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.\", '', 'Hi.', 'Ross, you remember Susan.', 'How could I forget?', 'Ross.', \"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?\", 'Dr. Oberman.', '..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-', 'She.', '-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?', \"Yes, and she's very supportive.\", \"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.\", 'Thanks.', 'Quack, quack..', 'Ross? That opens my cervix.', 'Barry?', \"C'mon in.\", 'Are you sure?', \"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.\", 'Huh?!', 'So, how ya doin?', \"I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!\", 'Yeah, well..', \"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.\", 'Be right there. Be back in a sec.', '', 'I dumped him.', 'Okay.', \"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?\", \"Give me a 'for instance'.\", \"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?\", 'Marlon-', 'Marlon?!', \"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.\", '...As in Mouse?', 'As in my grandmother.', 'Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?', 'Julia..', 'We agreed on Minnie.', \"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?\", 'Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?', 'Oh, not much. I-I got a job.', \"Oh, that's great.\", 'Why are- why are you so tanned?', 'Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.', 'Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?', 'No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.', 'Me?!', 'No! I went with Mindy.', 'Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!', \"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.\", \"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!\", \"Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.\", \"And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!\", 'Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.', 'Okay..', \"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.\", 'Wow.', \"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.\", 'What?', 'Me.', 'Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.', 'Well, thank you for giving it back.', '', 'Hello?!', \"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?\", \"Helen Geller? I don't think so.\", \"Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.\", 'Thank you!', \"No, I mean it's not Geller.\", \"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?\", 'No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.', 'Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?', \"It's my baby too.\", \"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.\", 'Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!', 'All right, you two, stop it!', \"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.\", \"Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.\", \"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.\", \"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!\", \"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-\", 'Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?', 'Yeah. Yeah. A little.', 'Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..', \"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.\", '', 'Oh my God.', 'Look at that.', 'I know.', \"Well? Isn't that amazing?\", 'What are we supposed to be seeing here?', \"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.\", 'You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.', \"Then don't do that, alright?\", 'Okay!', 'Monica. Whaddya think?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'Wh- are you welling up?', 'No.', \"You are, you're welling up.\", 'Am not!', \"You're gonna be an aunt.\", 'Oh shut up!', \"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
