      "159 She didn't reveal my secret. Quite the opposite.\n",

      "175 Nothing lasts forever.\n",
      "176 It was time for me to give in to my years.\n",
      "177 Next Christmas would be the last. My last Christmas.\n",

      "376 Well, I didn't make it worse.\n",
      "377 Oh, I'm so sorry I'm such a mess.\n",
      "378 And on top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't work.\n",

      "389 The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.\n",

      "392 Well, I'm not trying to have sex with her.\n",

      "394 |||| What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me?\n",
      "395 |||| I'm a male and she's a female.\n",
      "396 |||| Yes, but not of the same species.\n",
      "397 I'm not gonna engage in hypotheticals here.\n",

      "457 |||| She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.\n",
      "458 Well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it exists in contradistinction to the higher-level distal cause.\n",
      "459 - Which is?\n",
      "460 - You think with your penis.\n",
      "461 |||| That's a biological impossibility, and you didn't have to come.\n",
      "462 |||| I could have stayed behind to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.\n",

      "509 It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.\n",
      "510 And you were right about my motives.\n",
