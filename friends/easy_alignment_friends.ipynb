      "457 Isn't there?\n",
      "458 Yeah, yeah. I think there is.\n",

      "467 - Two years.\n",
      "468 - Wow.\n",
      "469 I'm glad you smashed her watch.\n",
      "470 So you still think you might want that fifth date?\n",
      "471 Yeah. Yeah, I do.\n",
      "472 We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..\n",
      "473 and Charles.\n",

      "481 Do the words, \"Billy, don't be a hero,\" mean anything to you?\n",
      "482 Great story.\n",
      "483 But I gotta go.\n",
      "484 I got a date with Andrea. Angela. No, Andrea.\n",

      "495 - That is amazing.\n",
      "496 If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.\n",
      "497 I think it's, \"If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.\"\n",

      "518 Yeah, we all have jobs.\n",
      "519 That's how we buy stuff.\n",
      "520 - Yeah, I'm an actor.\n",
      "521 - Have I seen you in anything?\n",
      "522 I doubt it.\n",
      "523 Mostly regional work.\n",

      "535 Did you talk to Barry?\n",
      "536 I can't stop smiling.\n",
      "537 I see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.\n",

      "565 I take credit for Paul.\n",
      "566 Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.\n",
      "567 Of course it was a line.\n",
      "568 Why would anybody do something like that?\n",
      "569 I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than:\n",
      "570 \"To get you into bed.\"\n",
      "571 I hate men.\n",
      "572 Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe.\n",
      "573 Is it me?\n",
      "574 Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs..\n",
      "575 and men with emotional problems can hear?\n",
      "576 Come here. Give me your feet.\n",
      "577 I just thought he was nice, you know?\n",
      "578 I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.\n",
      "579 - Guess what?\n",
      "580 - You got a job?\n",
      "581 Are you kidding?\n",
      "582 I'm trained for nothing.\n",
      "583 - I was laughed out of 12 interviews.\n",
      "584 - You're surprisingly upbeat.\n",
      "585 You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale..\n",
      "586 50% off.\n",
      "587 How well you know me.\n",

      "592 And who pays for that?\n",
      "593 My father.\n",
      "594 Is this really necessary?\n",
      "595 I can stop charging any time.\n",
      "596 You can't live off your parents.\n",
      "597 I know that. That's why I was getting married.\n",
